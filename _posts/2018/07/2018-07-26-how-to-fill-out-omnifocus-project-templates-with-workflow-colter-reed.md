Project templates are a very smart idea and one I use a lot. It helps you not forget things in the future. This is a brilliant way to deal with project templates in OmniFocus, but I have to get over my resistance to putting the templates themselves into my OmniFocus system. I prefer to keep them outside of it until they are populated.
