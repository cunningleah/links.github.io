New-ish book from [Charles Betz](https://www.linkedin.com/in/charlestbetz/), published in the open on the web. 

> My answer would be that there is something different happening this time â€” digital delivery is becoming core, not context. The convergence of an abundance of computing resources, improving software development management, combined with a change in market focus from the supplier to the customer is changing the way we view Enterprise Architecture and IT management, and identifying the need to develop a digital workforce. The defining characteristics of a digital enterprise are becoming clear:
> 
> * Products or services that are either delivered fully digitally (e.g., digital media or online banking), or where physical products and services are obtained by the customer by digital means (e.g., online car sharing services)
> 
> * A "digital-first" culture, where the business models, plans, architectures, and implementation strategies start from an assumption of digital delivery
> 
> * A workforce who is digitally savvy enough to execute a digital-first approach

I met Charles once at the Chaos Day event here in Minneapolis. He has a comprehensive and deep view on technology.
