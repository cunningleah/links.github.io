Much has been written about Amazon's processes for making new products. This writeup from Amazon CTO Werner Vogels is brief and to the point on the process.

> The Working Backwards product definition process is all about is fleshing out the concept and achieving clarity of thought about what we will ultimately go off and build.

There is a lot to like here. I tend to think the best processes and frameworks for product management push for clarity and insuring that all the connective components of a product are thought out. Itâ€™s not hard to identify 3 or 4 big features. The hard work comes in figuring out how it all connects together.
