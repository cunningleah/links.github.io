I applaud this effort. It has the potential to recognize that moving large amounts of data between cloud services can sometimes be very difficult, and often involve a slow intermediate broadband connection. Just consider downloading 100,000 photos to your home to then upload to another service. It will be immensely faster for the services to exchange them directly. There is additional detail in the [Verge article](https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/20/17589246/data-transfer-project-google-facebook-microsoft-twitter) announcing this.
