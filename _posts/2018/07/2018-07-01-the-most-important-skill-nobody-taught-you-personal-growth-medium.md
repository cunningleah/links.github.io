I believe there is a lot of truth to this thought. I often refer to social media as spray foam for the mind. It fills all the little gaps with stuff, instead of some solitude or plain boredom. 

> We ignore the fact that never facing this nothingness is the same as never facing ourselves. And never facing ourselves is why we feel lonely and anxious in spite of being so intimately connected to everything else around us.

This but is like a gateway to Buddhist practices. If you face yourself, you need to figure out what self is.
