Like many technologists, I find [M. C. Escher's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M._C._Escher) art mesmerizing. This collection of prints from the Boston Library are a great way to experience them. The digitizations are very high resolution. This made me look for M. C. Escher desktop wallpaper for my computer, but everything I found was not high quality.
