Nice to see ACM update it’s Code of Ethics. Amazing that it hadn't been updated in 26 years. Consider how much the world of computing has changed in 26 years.

> After a two-year process that included extensive input from computing professionals around the world, ACM, the Association for Computing Machinery, has updated its [Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct](https://www.acm.org/about-acm/acm-code-of-ethics-and-professional-conduct). The revised Code of Ethics addresses the significant advances in computing technology and the growing pervasiveness of computing in all aspects of society since it was last updated in 1992.

I applaud the continuing discussion around ethics in computing. It’s nice to see privacy included in the code.
