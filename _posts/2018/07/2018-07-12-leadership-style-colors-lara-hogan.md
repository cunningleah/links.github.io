This article instantly made me think of [Insights](https://www.insights.com/us/) which I have used through [Discovery Yourself](https://discoveryourself.com) many times. I've seen teams get value out of having shared language around colors and style. This suggestion is to build on that to be more comprehensive, and also to try operating in other colors, which I think is something you have to do from time-to-time. I lead red/blue myself.
