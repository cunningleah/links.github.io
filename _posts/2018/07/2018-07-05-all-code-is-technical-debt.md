I've often shared with technical teams that what we do everyday in technology is create tomorrow's technical debt. I often think itâ€™s wrong that we consider software an intangible asset in most companies. As a CTO, I tend to think of software as a liability that will inevitably need help. The asset against that liability is the team of people that build, run and maintain that software.
