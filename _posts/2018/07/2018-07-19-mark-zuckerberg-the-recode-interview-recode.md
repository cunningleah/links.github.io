Kara Swisher interviewing Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg. Swisher is a tough interviewer. Zuckerberg has gotten a lot of training on how to keep on message.

> I think the interview gives a picture of an earnest and canny tech leader who is also grappling with the darker side of his creation. At one point, I asked him who was to blame and who should pay the price for the Cambridge Analytica controversy and he rightly named himself, as the person who invented Facebook. “Do you want me to fire myself on this podcast?” Zuckerberg joked. Spoiler alert: He did not.

Zuckerberg is very thoughtful. I’m not a fan of his service, but it was interesting to hear the discussion.
