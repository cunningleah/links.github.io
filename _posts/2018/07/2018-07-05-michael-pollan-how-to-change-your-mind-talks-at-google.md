This talk piqued my interest in [Michael Pollan](https://michaelpollan.com)'s new book [How to Change Your Mind](https://michaelpollan.com/books/how-to-change-your-mind/) about psychedelics. Don't be discouraged that the talk is all Q&A style, which I often find meandering and less impactful. The questions are good and the topics covered are interesting. I was surprised to see meditation make a showing in the discussion as well.
