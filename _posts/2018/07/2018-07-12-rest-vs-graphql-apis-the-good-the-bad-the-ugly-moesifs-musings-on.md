I love the conclusion in this overview.

> In fact, GraphQL vs REST is like comparing SQL technologies vs noSQL. There are certain applications where it makes sense to model complex entities in a SQL Db. Whereas other apps that only have “messages” as in high volume chat apps or analytics APIs where the only entity is an “event” may be more suited using something like Cassandra.

We **always** do this in tech it seems, too much "versus" as opposed to it’s just different and serves a different solution. Again, pick the right tool for the job. 🔨
