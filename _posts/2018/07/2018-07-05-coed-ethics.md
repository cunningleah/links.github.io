I absolutely love that this is a thing! 

> This is a radically new event championing bottom-up, developer-driven ethics. How can we make technologists the last bastion of defence against unethical products? After all, we design, write and deploy them.

I’m hoping they share videos from the sessions. I’m very pleased to see this conversation happening. 🏆
