Everything in this post is awesome.

> Well, my leadership team and I soon learned that people hated our reviews. Folks who hadn't even been to one feared them by reputation. Why? We were overzealous about our own contributions and under-appreciative of the presenting team, which was disrespectful. Luckily, several regular attendees gave us that feedback and we were able to turn things around with what I call “The P Rules,” which I left written on our whiteboard for years.

This is great advice for teams and for leaders.
