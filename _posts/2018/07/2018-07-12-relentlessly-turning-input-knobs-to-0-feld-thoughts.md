I feel like I've been doing this for a few years now. I would add another thought though, which is I would start with turning the input **channels** as low as possible, and then reduce the number of things in those channels. Right now I only have three channels that are meaningful: email (traditional, regular email), messages (95% iMessage) and feeds (all via Feedbin). Note that social media isn't a channel. Then I filter inside those channels.
