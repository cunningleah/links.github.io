I've learned a lot from listening to [Mac Power Users](https://www.relay.fm/mpu) and [David Sparks](https://www.macsparky.com). I was excited to hear that he and Rosemary Orchard are launching a new podcast [Automators](https://automators.fm/). ðŸŽ§ The focus of this new podcast is just on automation, something I've gotten a lot of value out of. Here is [Rosemary Orchard's announcement](https://www.rosemaryorchard.com/blog/launching-automators-podcast) as well.
