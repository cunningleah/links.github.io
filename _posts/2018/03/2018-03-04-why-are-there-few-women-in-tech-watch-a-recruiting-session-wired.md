I'd like to go back and read the original paper [Puncturing the pipeline: Do technology companies alienate women in recruiting sessions?](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0306312718756766) but had to due with this Wired writeup for now.

> In an attempt to appear approachable, presenters often made comments that disparaged women or depicted them as sexualized objects rather than talented technical colleagues. For example, in one session, a man mentioned the “better gender ratio” at the company’s Los Angeles office compared with its Silicon Valley office. “I had no girlfriends at [University Name], but now I’m married,” he said, suggesting that the better odds had helped get him hitched.

🤦‍♂️ There is so much work to do on this issue.
