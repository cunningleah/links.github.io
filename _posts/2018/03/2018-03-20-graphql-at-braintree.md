Interesting overview of how Braintree evaluated and ultimately chose to use GraphQL for their published API's.

> The previously mentioned benefits would be enough to make a reasonable case for adopting GraphQL on their own. Our biggest surprise, however, was how perfectly suited GraphQL is for powering an orchestration layer.
> 
> GraphQL forces you to cleanly separate logic for retrieving data from logic that composes this data and presents it to the user. You write code for the former and your GraphQL framework handles the latter.

Also highlights challenges they had. Good read.
