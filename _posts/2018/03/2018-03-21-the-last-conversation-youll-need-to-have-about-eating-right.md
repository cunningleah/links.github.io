[Mark Bittman](http://markbittman.com) and [David Katz](http://davidkatzmd.com) on food.

> Ask us anything at all about diet and nutrition and we will give you an answer that is grounded in real scientific consensus, with no “healthy-ish” chit-chat, nary a mention of “wellness,” and no goal other than to cut through all the noise and help everyone see how simple it is to eat well.

Incredibly wide-ranging Q&A.
