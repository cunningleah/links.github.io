I have a lot of admiration for [Redis](https://redislabs.com) and the solutions around it. I did some light coding with Redis and it is very easy to understand and use. This new module system to make Redis more extensible sounds interesting. Here is a graph database built in Redis.

> RedisGraph is a graph database developed from scratch on top of Redis, using the new Redis Modules API to extend Redis with new commands and capabilities. Its main features include: - Simple, fast indexing and querying - Data stored in RAM, using memory-efficient custom data structures - On disk persistence - Tabular result sets - Simple and popular graph query language (Cypher) - Data Filtering, Aggregation and ordering
