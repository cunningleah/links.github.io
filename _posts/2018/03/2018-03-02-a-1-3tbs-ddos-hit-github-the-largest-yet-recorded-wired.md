I’m continuously surprised why GitHub is so frequently the target of [DDoS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack) attacks, but this is an amazing timeline:

> GitHub briefly struggled with intermittent outages as a digital system assessed the situation. Within 10 minutes it had automatically called for help from its DDoS mitigation service, Akamai Prolexic. Prolexic took over as an intermediary, routing all the traffic coming into and out of GitHub, and sent the data through its scrubbing centers to weed out and block malicious packets. After eight minutes, attackers relented and the assault dropped off.

That is an impressive, automated response to such a significant event. 👏
