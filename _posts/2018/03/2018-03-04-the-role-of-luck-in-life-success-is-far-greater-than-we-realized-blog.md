Itâ€™s human nature to want to associate your successes with skill and active choice (and often our misses with *bad luck*), but data suggests that luck, or random chance, may have more to do with success.

> The researchers argue that the following factors are all important in giving people more chances of success: a stimulating environment rich in opportunities, a good education, intensive training, and an efficient strategy for the distribution of funds and resources.

This made me thing of [Fooled by Randomness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fooled_by_Randomness) as I read it. I highly recommend that book. It forever changed how I look at track records.
