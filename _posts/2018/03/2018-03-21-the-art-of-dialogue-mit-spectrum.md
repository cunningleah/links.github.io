Brief reminder of what true dialogue really is.

> Dialogue is essential to solve the large problems of a multicultural, global society, he adds. Finding a new way to talk, think, and act together makes it possible to talk across our differences and invent new directions for the future.

This topic reminded me of [The Most Human Human](https://www.amazon.com/Most-Human-Talking-Computers-Teaches/dp/0385533063/), which is a very fun read.
