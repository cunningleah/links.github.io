This is an exceptionally true sentiment…

> As the size and sprawl and complexity of our systems skyrockets, many of us are finding that the most valuable skill sets sit at the intersection of two or more disciplines.

… and more …

> You don’t need to know how to do everything under the sun. You do need to have respect for all the other disciplines that enhance your own and make your job possible, and vice versa.

This is absolutely the write way to think of being on a technology **team**.
