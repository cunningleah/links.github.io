I was a customer of Atlassian and felt the problems they had in their single-tennant VPS environment. We couldn't wait for it to get fixed and ultimately moved it in-house, but it’s good to hear that they have made a full transition into the cloud. It also sounds like they evolved the solution to work better in the cloud. Hat tip to [Peter Zaballos](https://meaningfulfailure.com) for the link.
