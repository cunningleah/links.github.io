Overview of all of the missteps Facebook has had recently.

> Seemingly not an hour goes by these days that I don’t open Techmeme and see some ridiculous headline related to the latest Facebook faux pas. At best, the mistakes are eye-roll-inducing. At worst, they’re jaw-droppingly awful. And there are plenty in between which are just some combination of boneheaded, cringe-worthy, tactless, or tasteless.

I would suggest that their frequency of issues is because they have no grounding ethics or principles. They lurch from issue to issue with no "true north" regarding their customers, their users and their principles. Just stumbling around.
