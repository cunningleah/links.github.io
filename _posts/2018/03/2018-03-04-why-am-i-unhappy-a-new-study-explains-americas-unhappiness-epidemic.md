Another study suggesting that the increase of time spent in the digital world correlates strongly with unhappiness.

> Every year, teens are asked about their general happiness, in addition to how they spend their time. We found that teens who spent more time seeing their friends in person, exercising, playing sports, attending religious services, reading or even doing homework were happier. However, teens who spent more time on the internet, playing computer games, on social media, texting, using video chat or watching TV were less happy.

Should it surprise us that humans, perhaps the most social of creatures, don't get satisfied socially through text messages and whatever app you are using today? Nope.
