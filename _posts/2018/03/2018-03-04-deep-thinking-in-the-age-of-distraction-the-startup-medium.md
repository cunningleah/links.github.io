I'd rather this was just called "Thinking" instead of "Deep Thinking". We don't need to "Deep Think" and "Deep Work" all the time. I'd rather focus on creating time to **not** be distracted. One of the things I've done in this area is to find common situations where I habitually grab my phone, elevator rides are a common one, and force myself to stop doing that. If you take transit, do one day a week with no mobile.
