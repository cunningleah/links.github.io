If you have a need to use RSS to access Twitter.

> Way back in the mists of time twitter used to have RSS feeds. It was great and people used them. I even made a twitter RSS getter form for my website so you could locate your feed. But in June 2013 they killed the RSS feeds.

Handy. And in Perl!
