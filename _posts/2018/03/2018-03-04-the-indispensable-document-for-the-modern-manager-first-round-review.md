I have mixed feelings about managers publishing a "User Guide". In short, I think the job off a manager and leader is to adapt to the people who they work with. I worry a user guide says "this is what I want, you adapt to me". I tend to think that managers need to understand "this is what you need, and I will adapt to you". However, this example of a user guide is very well thought out, and the best one I've seen at communicating something that seems more focused on outcomes.
