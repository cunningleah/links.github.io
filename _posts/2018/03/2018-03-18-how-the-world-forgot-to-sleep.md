The book [Why We Sleep](https://www.amazon.com/Why-We-Sleep-Unlocking-Dreams/dp/1501144316/), referenced here, is on my list to read (Tammy read it a while back). Iâ€™ve learned to respect sleep. I also routinely take [REM Caps](https://www.hammernutrition.com/products/recovery/rem-caps/), which are a mix of melatonin and 5HTP, both also referenced in this article. Being more mindful of our sleep patterns is a good idea. ðŸ˜´
