What an interesting idea! 

> You'll create a special URL which you'll then embed in your secret place. If a thief steals your secret and accesses the URL, we'll immediately send you an alert so that you'll know the secret has been stolen, and you'll learn the IP address and User-Agent of the attacker.

Cool.
