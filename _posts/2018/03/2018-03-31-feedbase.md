I love this idea. Feed discovery is one of the bigger challenges of the open web. 👍

> Welcome to feedBase, which as its name implies, a database of feeds. I'm asking people who read my blog to upload their OPML subscription lists, so we can mash them together and produce a graph of users and feeds that you can walk, learn from, and discover new feeds to subscribe to.

I [signed up and uploaded my OPML](http://feedbase.io/?username=thingles) to see how it works. I like this, but think it is probably a bigger project than Winer may be envisioning.
