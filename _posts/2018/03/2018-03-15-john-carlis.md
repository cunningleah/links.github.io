John Carlis was the Dean of Undergraduate Studies when I was in the Computer Science at the University of Minnesota. I took Lisp from John, and on several occasions we got a chance to catch up. He was an amazing professor and human being. Sadly the last time I saw him was at [John Riedl's funeral](https://www.thingelstad.com/2013/goodbye-to-my-friend-john-riedl/). Also see [In Memoriam: John Carlis](https://www.cs.umn.edu/news/memoriam-john-carlis).
