Mary Meeker's Internet Trend reports are things of legend now. At 294 slides there is a lot here, as always. Interesting observations:

* 5.9 hours spent online per day. Up from 2.7 in 2008 and 5.6 just last year. Wondering where all your time went? There it is.
* There are 450 million WiFi networks. Wow! Turns out IPv4 lasted longer than we ever thought. ðŸ˜³
* China has 500 million mobile payment users.
* There are over 30 million Amazon Echo devices out there. 
* You are worth $34/year to Facebook.
* E-commerce is 13% of all retail sales.
* Alibaba is clearly an Internet giant that most in the US have little knowledge of.
* Flexibility is most desired benefit employees seek.
* Time spent on social media alone, 135 minutes/day. 

This is all worth a couple of times through.
