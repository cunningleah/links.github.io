This is just cool. Microsoft put a bunch of servers in a tube and put it in the ocean! ðŸ’¦ They highlight that the cooling provided by the water is a big benefit, and that makes sense. In most data centers half of the energy is used to cool equipment. Itâ€™s just goofy to think of a bunch of servers floating around under the water. ðŸ¤¯
