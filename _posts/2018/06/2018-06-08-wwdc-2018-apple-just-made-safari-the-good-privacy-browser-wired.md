I ðŸ’™ Safari, and the privacy focus of Safari is a big part of it. That wasn't always the case, but over the last few years Apple has started to lead and even use this as a leading feature. I use Safari with [1Blocker](https://1blocker.com) and [Ghostery](https://www.ghostery.com), as well with all privacy settings set high. These additional features will be great!
