Google recently [withdrew itself from a Pentagon contract](https://mashable.com/2018/06/02/google-defense-department-project-maven-contract-not-renewed/#KFWLve1GGPqs) because of internal pressure from employees. Now the CEO of Google is framing up how they will use AI technology. We are getting into ethics here, which is a good thing. AI will force technology companies to make some hard decisions on the application. I hope we do a better job than we did with privacy.
