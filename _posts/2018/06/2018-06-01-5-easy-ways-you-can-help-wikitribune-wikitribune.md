I was really excited about WikiTribune when it first launched but lost enthusiasm with the way they were running. Now Jimmy Wales has flipped it inside out and made it a wiki, which is what I think most people thought it would be to start with! This project is interesting again, but I also wonder how the new level of fake news can be dealt with in a platform for news that is a straight wiki.
