Cool news from You Need a Budget!, they have a new [YNAB API](https://api.youneedabudget.com). We have been using [YNAB](https://www.youneedabudget.com) for a few years now and it works great for our family. Their transition a couple of years ago to a service-offering is allowing them to grow into new stuff like this API. I’m hopeful that this soon appears in [Zapier](https://zapier.com) and [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com) so I can build with it even more easily.
