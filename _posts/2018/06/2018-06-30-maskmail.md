I've advocated for strong password management for years, and it’s critical for security. But for privacy one of the key things to do is not use the same email address on every service. There are many anonymous email address services, but frankly most of them are highly suspect and I don't know their revenue strategy. Maskmail looks very legitimate and I like that they have a straight-forward subscription offering. I've started using it and it’s fast, well-designed and just works. $10/year is cheap.
