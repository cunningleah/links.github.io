Innovation needs a framework. Throwing hackathons at problems has a high likelihood of backfiring with frustration on adoption and outcomes.

> As organizations have moved from – individual innovators working alone, to adopting innovation tools and activities, to teaching teams about evidence-based innovation – our most important realization has been this: Having skills/tools and activities are critical building blocks but by themselves are insufficient to build a program that delivers results that matter to leadership.  It’s only when senior leaders see how an innovation process can deliver stuff that matters – at speed—that they take action to change the processes and procedures that get in the way.

This framework for thinking about innovation and it’s components is interesting.
