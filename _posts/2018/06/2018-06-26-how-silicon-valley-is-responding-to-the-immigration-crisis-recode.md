I am often very critical of Facebook, but this is an example of something that would definitely not happen without Facebook. This fundraiser started by trying to raise $1,500 for [RAICES to fund legal support for families separated at the border](https://actionnetwork.org/fundraising/bondfund). Within 2 days they had raised $1 million and are now over $20 million! I bypassed Facebook, but appreciated them highlighting this organization and [donated](https://actionnetwork.org/fundraising/bondfund) myself.
