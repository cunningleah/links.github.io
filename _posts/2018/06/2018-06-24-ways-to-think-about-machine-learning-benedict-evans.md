A grounded, reality-based view of the potential of machine learning and how we should be thinking about it in solutions.

> So, this is a good grounding way to think about ML today - it’s a step change in what we can do with computers, and that will be part of many different products for many different companies. Eventually, pretty much everything will have ML somewhere inside and no-one will care.

I like the pragmatic views in this.
