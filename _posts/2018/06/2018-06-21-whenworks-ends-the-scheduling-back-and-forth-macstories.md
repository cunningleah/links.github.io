Good overview of new service, [WhenWorks](https://when.works). In the past I've used [Calendly](https://calendly.com) to do this. WhenWorks has a great set of features and using an iOS app to bridge to your calendars instead of doing server-to-server integration on the backend is novel. Services like this are very useful for people with busy calendars. It still doesn't solve the group scheduling problem which I still use [Doodle](https://doodle.com) for.
