Counter-point to recent trends of introducing mindfulness tactics into the workplace. The article doesn't talk about stress reduction, which I find suspect. Given equally low stressed people, will mindfulness help or not? I’m not sure. Given a very stressed person, will mindfulness help them? I think yes.
