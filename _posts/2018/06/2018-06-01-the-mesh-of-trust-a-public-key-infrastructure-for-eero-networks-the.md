What Eero is doing here seems really interesting.

> To recap, we’ve added a public key infrastructure to every eero network capable of operating in isolation from the global internet’s TLS system.

That PKI infrastructure on your wireless routers could support improved security for a number of things in your home. It will be fun to see where they go with this.
