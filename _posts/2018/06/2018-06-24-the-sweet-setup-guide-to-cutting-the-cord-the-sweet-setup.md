Thorough guide to various options for getting rid of cable TV (or satellite TV). I [cut the cord in 2009](https://www.thingelstad.com/2009/directv-canceled/). The options now are great. I've long had an Apple TV attached to each TV we have. I've recently gotten the [HDHomeRun](https://www.silicondust.com/hdhomerun/) referenced here and am using it with Plex on my Synology NAS. We also have Netflix, Hulu and HBO Now subscriptions.
