Review of [Jaron Lanier's](http://www.jaronlanier.com) new book [Ten Arguments For Deleting Your Social Media Accounts Right Now](https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781250196682). The book itself does not get a glowing review, but it comes with a punch at the end.

> Only at the very end does Lanier venture into new territory. His argument, however, is a profound one. He worries that our reliance on big tech companies is ruining our capacity for spirituality, by turning us into robotic extensions of their machines.

If you are less versed in the debate about social media the book may be more novel.
