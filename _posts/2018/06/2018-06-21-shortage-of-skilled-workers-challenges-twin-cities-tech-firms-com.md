Snapshot of the exceedingly difficult talent environment for companies in the Twin Cities area.

> The Twin Cities added 3,300 technology jobs last year, up 1.6 percent to 199,200. The area is one of the nationâ€™s 15 largest tech-employment hubs, according to the Computing Technology Industry Association (CompTIA). These jobs typically pay seasoned workers $75,000 to $100,000 or more a year.
