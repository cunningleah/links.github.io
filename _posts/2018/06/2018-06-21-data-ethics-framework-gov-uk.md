We need more ethics discussion in technology, and this framework applied to data is an interesting example.

> Data ethics is an emerging branch of applied ethics which describes the value judgements and approaches we make when generating, analysing and disseminating data. This includes a sound knowledge of data protection law and other relevant legislation, and the appropriate use of new technologies. It requires a holistic approach incorporating good practice in computing techniques, ethics and information assurance.

I'd love to see some companies share their approach for the same thing.
