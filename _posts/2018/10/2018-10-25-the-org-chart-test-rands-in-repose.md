Interesting idea of insuring that the org chart is clearly articulated and known, as a way to insure that communications are happening right.

> An org chart should also effectively describe, at a high level, how the product is organized and also who is responsible for what. An org chart should be legible.

Interesting idea to bring this into a 1:1 discussion.
