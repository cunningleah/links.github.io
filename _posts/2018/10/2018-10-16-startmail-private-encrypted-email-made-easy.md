Nice to see another web-based, easy-to-use encrypted email service. This one has some additional privacy features that look great. I maintain an encrypted address at [Protonmail](https://protonmail.com) which has some similar features. As an aside, it’s notable that all encrypted email services I know of tout that their servers are **not** located in the United States as a feature. It’s sad that our government is known to treat digital right-to-privacy with so low regard.
