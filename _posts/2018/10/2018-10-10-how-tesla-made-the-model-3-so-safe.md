This article highlights some of the amazing safety aspects of the Tesla Model 3.

> So basically, when Tesla says its Model 3 has the “lowest probability of injury” ever tested by NHTSA, it means that the overall VSS score (which represents the “relative risk of injury with respect to a baseline of 15 percent”) of 0.38 is lower than that of any car ever tested.
> 
> That’s impressive, any way you slice it.

**Lowest ever** is very impressive!
