I know that feeling!

> Many of us have a constant neverending feeling that weâ€™re always behind on what we need to get done.

Okay, now you got my attention.

> And all of a sudden, youâ€™re not behind on anything. Because what youâ€™re doing right now is enough. And itâ€™s all you have. Which is perfect, as it is.

A very Zen view on contentment. There is a lot of truth here, particularly the part about us creating our own anxiety rushing to the next thing. ðŸ¤”
