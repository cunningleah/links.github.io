Good clarifying post on the purpose and approach for mission, vision, strategy, etc. The last paragraph resonated with me.

> Interestingly, this post is an example of something even more paramount than having a mission: providing a common language for the team to use that everyone understands. Ensuring people use terms consistently isnâ€™t just pedantry, it is potentially critical to scaling execution.

This is so true. In a larger organization simply getting everyone talking using similar definitions is a big deal. The language and definitions behind it will fundamentally alter how people use these things.
