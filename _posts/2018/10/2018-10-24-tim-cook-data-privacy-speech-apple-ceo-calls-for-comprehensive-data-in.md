Apple CEO [Tim Cook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Cook) presenting on the complete disregard of privacy in the technology industry. His term of "data industrial complex" is very accurate, and I completely agree with his extension that "this is surveillance".

He coins four essential rights: right to have personal data minimized, right to knowledge, right to access, and right to security. I like the simplicity.

You can see the video [directly on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVhOLkIs20A) or if you prefer read the [ArsTechnica transcript](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2018/10/tim-cook-calls-for-strong-us-privacy-law-rips-data-industrial-complex/).

Cook references [Steve Jobs' talking about privacy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39iKLwlUqBo). I appreciate that Apple is leading the tech industry on this important topic. Itâ€™s also clear that Cook is personally passionate on this topic. He even pulls [Henry David Thoreau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_David_Thoreau) in at the end.
