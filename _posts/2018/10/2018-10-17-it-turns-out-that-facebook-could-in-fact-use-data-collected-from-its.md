I absolutely love that Facebook themselves had to correct publications on this clarification.

> But Facebook has since reached out to change its answer: Portal doesnâ€™t have ads, but data about who you call and data about which apps you use on Portal can be used to target you with ads on other Facebook-owned properties.

So when you give your photos to Google and Facebook they mine brands and objects from them to advertise to you. WIth this Portal surveillance device they can watch the activity in your house to then shove things in between cat pictures on Instagram. **Don't buy one of these.** And also, ditch Facebook Messenger too.
