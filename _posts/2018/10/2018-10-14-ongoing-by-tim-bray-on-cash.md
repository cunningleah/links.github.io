I like Bray's perspective on cash here. I tend to still pay for most of my routine, small purchases with cash. I'd add to his list of reasons the fact that as we move from real cash we devalue the expense. Keeping transactions in cash will make you more conscious of your spending, and hopefully spend less. ðŸ’¸
