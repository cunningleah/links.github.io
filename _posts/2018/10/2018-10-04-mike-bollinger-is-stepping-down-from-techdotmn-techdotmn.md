This looks to be some fallout from a [controversial article](https://tech.mn/news/2018/09/19/poll-should-minnesota-techies-be-treated-differently-based-on-their-appearance/) published by Mikeâ€™s cofounder of TECHdotMN. Unclear where this leaves the local publication. I admire what they have been trying to do.
