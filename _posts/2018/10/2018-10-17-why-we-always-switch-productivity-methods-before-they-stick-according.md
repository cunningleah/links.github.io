I've talked to a lot of friends that have tried several or even dozens of *productivity systems*.

> First things first: Take some comfort in the fact that you definitely arenâ€™t alone. Many of us hop around and test the waters of various systems for getting our work done.

One of the best things I ever did was decide to commit to [GTD](https://www.gettingthingsdone.com) as a long-term investment as well as [OmniFocus](https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus) and not look around at other options. I felt that expertise and depth in one was more important than trying dozens of options fiddling with what might be best.
