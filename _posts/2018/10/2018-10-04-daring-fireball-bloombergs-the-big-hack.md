This [Bloomberg report on rogue chips from Supermicro](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2018-10-04/the-big-hack-how-china-used-a-tiny-chip-to-infiltrate-america-s-top-companies) infiltrating Amazon and Apple is pretty amazing. Gruber’s take on it is a good summary.

> I see no way around it: either Bloomberg’s report is significantly wrong, at least as pertains to Amazon and Apple, or Apple and Amazon have issued blatantly false denials.

Apple and Amazon both vehemently deny this report. Apple even issued a [second statement](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2018/10/what-businessweek-got-wrong-about-apple/) about it. It’s hard to know what really happened, but it’s notable to me that espionage at this level is known, and will impact how we can build new technology for certain purposes.
