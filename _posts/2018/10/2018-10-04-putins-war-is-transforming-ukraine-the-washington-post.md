I started traveling to Ukraine twice a year right after the conflict with Russia began. Iâ€™ve always found it very jarring when I read coverage of all the fighting, and then go there and it seems completely normal in the capital. Iâ€™m not sure about the trends in this article, but I would like it if this were the case.
