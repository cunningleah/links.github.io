It’s about time that technology workers factor the outcome of their work into their decision to work on it.

> Across the technology industry, rank-and-file employees are demanding greater insight into how their companies are deploying the technology that they built. At Google, Amazon, Microsoft and Salesforce, as well as at tech start-ups, engineers and technologists are increasingly asking whether the products they are working on are being used for surveillance in places like China or for military projects in the United States or elsewhere.
> 
> That’s a change from the past, when Silicon Valley workers typically developed products with little questioning about the social costs.

This is a good thing.
