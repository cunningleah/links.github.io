Nice overview of the startup activity happening here in the Twin Cities.

> The number of tech businesses in Minnesota has grown exponentially since 2010, adding more than 500 startups since 2015 alone. Following the charge, venture capitalists now invest more than $200 million in the region annually.

I was very glad to see [Minnestar](https://minnestar.org) mentioned along with a quote from our executive director!
