This article from [The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/10/17/17983018/helm-private-email-server-calendar-contacts-data) has a good introduction to Helm. It looks like an interesting solution for keeping your data in your control and even in your own residence where it is protected by the constitution. I donâ€™t see this displacing my current providers, and I wonder how it compares to something like a Synology NAS.
