I was very interested to read this. I've been an OmniFocus user since it was in beta, and lately Things 3 continues to get a lot of positive comments. I've considered switching, but I **really** don't want to do that. Switching task managers Is a major pain. This review ultimately came down on Things 3, but I’m going to wait for OmniFocus 3 before I make any decision.
