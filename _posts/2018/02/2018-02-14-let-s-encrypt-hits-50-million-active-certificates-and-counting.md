The web has **50 million* more secure HTTPS endpoints now in part thanks to Let's Encrypt. I continue to believe Let's Encrypt is one of the best things to happen online in the last couple of years. My sites are secured with free certificates from Let's Encrypt. [You should support this](https://supporters.eff.org/donate), even if you aren't publishing content. Securing web sites is important for your privacy and security! üîê
