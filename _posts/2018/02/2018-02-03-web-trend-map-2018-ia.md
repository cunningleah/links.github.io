The web has been consolidating to major corporations, losing sight of some of the original objectives.

> The Web has lost its spirit. The Web is no longer a distributed Web.

There are however sprouts of new activity.

> There seems to be a weak undercurrent of old and young bloggers like us that feel sentimental or curious and want to bring back blogging. Blogging won’t save the world. But, hell, after two weeks now, we can confirm: it feels great to be back on the blogging line.

I have nothing against successful companies online, but there needs to be space for other things. Commercial areas are fine, but I also want parks. Industrial activity is needed, but we need residential areas too. This all applies to the web as well.
