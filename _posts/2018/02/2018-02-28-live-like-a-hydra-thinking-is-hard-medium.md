I've read [Nassim Nicholas Taleb](http://www.fooledbyrandomness.com)'s [Antifragile](https://www.amazon.com/Antifragile-Things-That-Disorder-Incerto/dp/1400067820/) but this essay on applying anti fragile concepts to your life is interesting:

> An antifragile way of life is all about finding a way to gain from the inevitable disorder of life. To not only bounce back when things donâ€™t go as planned, but to get stronger, smarter, and better at continuing as a result of running into this disorder.

Thought provoking. ðŸ¤”
