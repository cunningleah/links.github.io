The permanence of digital content is something I think about for personal websites, but I hadn't considered how damaging that intersection could be for newspaper sites. I've supported [Internet Archive](https://archive.org) for years and their mission is to capture and save content. It seems like a good path would be for news websites content management systems to directly archive content into a place like Internet Archive and not rely on the web crawler to capture it.
