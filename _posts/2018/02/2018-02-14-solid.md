Itâ€™s not very clear what this is attempting to do, but I like the blurb.

> Solid (derived from "social linked data") is a proposed set of conventions and tools for building decentralized social applications based on Linked Data principles. Solid is modular and extensible and it relies as much as possible on existing W3C standards and protocols.

Notable that [Tim Berners-Lee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee) is involved.
