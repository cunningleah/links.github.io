If you have watched [King of Kong](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0923752/) you know the story of Billy Mitchell. After some incredibly detailed analysis, it seems his records were faked.

> In light of the evidence presented here, I am removing Billy Mitchell's current score of 1,062,800 from the Donkey Kong Forum High Score List.

The Internet is so great. If you find this story interesting, watch the movie! ðŸŽ¬
