I like this thought about how to approach blogging. 

> Small b blogging is writing things that you link back to and reference time and time again. Ideas that can evolve and grow as your thinking and audience grows.

Personally I think of my blogging activity as being as much or more for me as a way to clarify my thoughts and share learning, and if others dig it that is cool too.
