Honestly [bash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_%28Unix_shell%29) would be in my top 5 most often used tools and I know many people turn there nose to it. This writeup on tooling around bash though, including formatting, listing and unit testing is pretty cool. I had no idea there was a linter for bash!
