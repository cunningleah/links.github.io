Wow, this is pretty interesting and seems like it would be useful.

> Visualizing user attitudes and behaviors in an empathy map helps UX teams align on a deep understanding of end users. The mapping process also reveals any holes in existing user data.

In the DevOps movement there is a lot of discussion of empathy. I've personally put teams or projects together to specifically encourage developing empathy. A tool that you can use to map out empathy seems like it would be very useful.
