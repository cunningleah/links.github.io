It’s awesome to see AgileBits incorporate the [Pwned Password](https://www.troyhunt.com/ive-just-launched-pwned-passwords-version-2/) service from [Troy Hunt](https://www.troyhunt.com) within 24 hours of it being released! Also great that this is going to be incorporated into the Watch Tower capability of 1Password. I’m a big fan of [1Password for Families](https://1password.com/families/). I'd recommend all families use it to share secrets and passwords.
