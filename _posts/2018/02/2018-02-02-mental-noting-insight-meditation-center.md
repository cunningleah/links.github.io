I've been exploring meditation and through that have gotten some exposure to mental noting.

> In contrast to most thinking, noting is not discursive. It does not involve analysis or judgment. Rather, we simply give our current experience a one-word label. For example, upon hearing a sound we note ‘hearing’ without thinking further about the sound. Other common mental notes are ‘seeing’, ‘touching’, ‘feeling’, and ‘thinking’.

I've found this to be an interesting technique and even apply it to thoughts beyond meditation. I’m a novice to be sure at it but the concept is interesting. 🧘‍♂️
