Another person reflecting on opting out of Twitter.

> Quitting Twitter has been a genuine quality of life improvement for me. It's as though a dark, heavy cloud of negativity has lifted, and I no longer get worked up about whatever might be the trending shitstorm du jour. I feel more focused and positive, and generally in much better mental health.
