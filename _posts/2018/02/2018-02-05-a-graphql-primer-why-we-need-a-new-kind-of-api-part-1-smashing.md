Good introduction to the problem that [GraphQL](http://graphql.org) is solving and the history of [RPC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_procedure_call), [SOAP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOAP) and [REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) thus far. I continue to think GraphQL has high applicability to many application. Interestingly I think that REST and GraphQL may find a reason to co-exist for a long time. Make sure to read [part 2](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/01/graphql-primer-new-api-part-2/) of this as well.
