Some interesting learning here on the deeper ways that you can use Kubernetes in your application architecture.

> Kubernetes offers a full set of distributed primitives (such as pods, services, controllers) that addresses the requirements and drives the design of our applications. These new primitives and the platform capabilities dictate the guiding design principles and design patterns we use to implement all future services.

It also highlights the broad surface area of Kubernetes. The points on broad adoption across various platforms are also important to note.
