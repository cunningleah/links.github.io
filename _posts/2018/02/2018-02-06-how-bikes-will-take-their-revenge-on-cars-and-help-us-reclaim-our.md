An interesting take on how the future of "micro-transportation" may look. ðŸš² Having recently purchased an [electric Fat Bike](http://defiantbicycles.com) I can attest that it changes the ways you can use a bike and opens up a lot of options. I don't see any way for these models though to deal with climate and the fact that itâ€™s very cold and very hot in some places.
