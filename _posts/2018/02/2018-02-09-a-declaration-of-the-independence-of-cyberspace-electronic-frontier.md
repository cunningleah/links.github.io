Iâ€™m shocked that I had never read this article. Sadly [John Perry Barlow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Perry_Barlow), the founder of the [EFF](https://www.eff.org) and the author of this declaration recently passed away. Cory Doctorow has a [very nice remembrance](https://boingboing.net/2018/02/07/walk-in-the-rain.html) of him. From Doctorow:

> Today, Barlow is dead, and his vision is vindicated: the risks Barlow foresaw (along with other EFF founders like [John Gilmore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Gilmore_(activist)) and [Mitch Kapor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitch_Kapor)) are more imminent than ever; the organization that he started and the movement he kicked off has never been more badly needed.
