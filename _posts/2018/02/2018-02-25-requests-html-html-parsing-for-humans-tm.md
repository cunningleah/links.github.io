A new Python module from [Kenneth Reitz](https://www.kennethreitz.org/projects) of [Requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/#) fame. Reitz designs modules very well and this is worth looking at. Previously, the go to for this thing was [Beautiful Soup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/).
