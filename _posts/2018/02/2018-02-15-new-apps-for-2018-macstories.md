I always am curious to hear what apps Viticci is using and I love that he's highlighting some apps to improve himself, reminds me of my article on [apps that make you better](https://www.thingelstad.com/2017/what-apps-make-you-better/). I use [Headspace](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/headspace-meditation/id493145008?mt=8&uo=4&at=1001lxyE&ct=thingelstad_com) and [Streaks](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/streaks/id963034692?mt=8&uo=4&at=1001lxyE&ct=thingelstad_com) as well, and should look at Workouts++.
