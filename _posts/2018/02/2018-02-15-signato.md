Iâ€™m not a fan of script typefaces typically but this one is very well done.

> Signato is a font constructed on the basis of the manuscript of the Act of Independence of Lithuania. It is a gift to all independent people celebrating the hundredth anniversary of the restoration of the State. 

Also a really cool idea behind it.
