Detailed write up from Chris Dixon connecting decentralization with blockchain.

> The lesson is that when you compare centralized and decentralized systems you need to consider them dynamically, as processes, instead of statically, as rigid products. Centralized systems often start out fully baked, but only get better at the rate at which employees at the sponsoring company improve them. Decentralized systems start out half-baked but, under the right conditions, grow exponentially as they attract new contributors.

I wish I understood better how the blockchain tech would power these apps. I think it’s also possible we can get a decentralized solution on the existing Internet still as well.
