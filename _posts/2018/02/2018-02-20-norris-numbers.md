Interesting observations on the size of a codebase and the difficulty for programmers to manage it.

> At DreamWorks we had 950 programs for animators to use, and a line count showed that the larger ones all hovered around 20,000 to 25,000 lines. Beyond that it was just too much effort to add features.
