I like what [Brent Simmons](http://inessential.com/) is doing with this project. Iâ€™m a big user of feed readers. I use [Feedbin](https://feedbin.com) along [ReadKit](http://readkitapp.com) and [Unread](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/unread-rss-reader/id1252376153?mt=8). Brent has a history with readers [having created](http://inessential.com/apps_ive_made) NetNewsWire in 2002. I also love the story behind the name. ðŸ’š

> But the name is a prayer for the open web â€”Â may it remain evergreen.
