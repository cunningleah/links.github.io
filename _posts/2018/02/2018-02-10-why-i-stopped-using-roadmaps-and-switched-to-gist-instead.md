I spend a lot of time reviewing roadmaps, identifying how roadmaps connect, exploring what they could be, etc. I have always found the serial, "waterfall-like" format, challenging but time operates in one arrow so why not. This exploration on an alternative, more agile approach, is intriguing.

> The system is called GIST after its main building blocks: Goals, Ideas, Step-projects, and Tasks. Each has a different planning horizon and frequency of change, and may use different tools to track, but together they constitute all the core planning any company and team needs to do.
