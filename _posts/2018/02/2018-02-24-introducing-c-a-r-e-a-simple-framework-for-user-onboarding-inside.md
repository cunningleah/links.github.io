Solid set of practices from Intercom on how they do customer onboarding. This is a huge area of focus for SaaS companies, particularly B2C ones.

> As your business grows and gets different types of customers, your onboarding will need to adapt. You’ll never be “finished” working on onboarding. And even your most loyal and active customers need to be continually onboarded to new areas of your product.

You have to adapt these plays in the B2B market but the thinking behind this is what I would attempt to model. 🤔
