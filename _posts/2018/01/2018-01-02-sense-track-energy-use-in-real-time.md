I shared my [frustration with the reporting](https://micro.thingelstad.com/2017/12/29/i-want-to.html) that my power company provides and [Luke Samaha](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lukesamaha/) [pointed me to](https://twitter.com/LukeSamaha/status/947135160323059712) Sense. This looks like a pretty amazing device and some great data. I like the premise of identifying the changes and then having the user annotate what happened. Wish it cost half as much though.
