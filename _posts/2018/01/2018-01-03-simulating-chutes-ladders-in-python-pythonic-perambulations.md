Oh the fun you can have playing with some Python code and a simple game. If you've been subjected to many games of Chutes & Ladders this will give you some new ways to appreciate the game. ðŸ˜…

> With two players, this translates to a 1% chance that the game will go 72 moves without either of the players winning. Assuming roughly 20 seconds per round, that is about 24 minutes of play time, though from personal experience I can say it feels roughly twenty times that long.
