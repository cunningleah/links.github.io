[Joel Spolsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_Spolsky) weighs in on writing software with ethics and meaning. 

> As software developers and designers, we have a responsibility to the world to think these things through carefully and design software that makes the world better, or, at least, no worse than it started out. 

👏
