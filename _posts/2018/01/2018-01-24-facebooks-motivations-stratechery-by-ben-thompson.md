I’m very direct with people in my dislike of Facebook specifically for a number of reasons. Most people think I’m crazy and that charging at privacy windmills is just that, pointless. My opinion on the real threat to Facebook is perfectly captured in Bon Thompson's writeup here:

> Rather, the only thing that could undo Facebook’s power is users actively rejecting the app. And, I suspect, the only way users would do that en masse would be if it became accepted fact that Facebook is actively bad for you — the online equivalent of smoking.

If it is established that social media just isn't good for you, I think that this analogy to smoking could be very accurate. We'll see.
