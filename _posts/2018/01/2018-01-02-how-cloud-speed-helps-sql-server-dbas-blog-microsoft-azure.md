Nice article going into some depth on how Microsoft has had to completely rethink how they deliver SQL Server to make it work for a cloud platform. I like that this highlights the stuff that often isn't considered as you shift software to a  cloud deployment strategy. Velocity and speed are highlighted in ways they never are in other models.
