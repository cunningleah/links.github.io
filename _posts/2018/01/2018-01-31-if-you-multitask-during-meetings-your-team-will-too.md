Interesting to see some analysis on being distracted in meetings and the tone it sets.

> This sends the signal, “It’s OK to not pay attention.” Managers that frequently send emails during meetings are, according to our analysis, are 2.2 times more likely to have direct reports who also multi-task in meetings.

This makes a lot of sense. I try to stay focused and not get distracted in meetings, and this gives even more reason to make that a priority.
