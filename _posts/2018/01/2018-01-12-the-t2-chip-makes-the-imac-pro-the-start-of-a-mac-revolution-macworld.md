Interesting article about how this new T2 chip in the iMac Pro is handling a significant amount of non-CPU and non-GPU work.

> On most Macs, there are discrete controllers for audio, system management and disk drives. But the T2 handles all these tasks. The T2 is responsible for controlling the iMac Proâ€™s stereo speakers, internal microphones, and dual cooling fans, all by itself.

The two-stage boot process is interesting and I think a first.
