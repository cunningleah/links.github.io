Some pretty big features coming in iOS 11.3. When I first saw Apple Pay Cash shown my head went right away to that being a great way to buy items from small merchants. The challenge was on the merchant side, but this new Business Chat capability is directly solving that. Iâ€™m going to guess that iMessage using iCloud is a critical dependency for Business Chat. I also like the additions to the Health app. It seems odd that you cannot currently store the results of a Dr. visit in Health, which hopefully this will solve.
