I know craft breweries 🍺 in Minneapolis have been popping up everywhere and it seems they have in the rest of the country too. This article is interesting for the topic of beer, but I find it more interesting for the observations about the regulatory structure and what it encourages. 

> Third, even in an economy obsessed with efficiency, sometimes it is just as wise to design for inefficiency. Alcohol regulations have long discouraged vertical consolidation, encouraged retailers to leave room for new brands, and more recently made it easier for individuals to introduce their own batch of beer to the market.

How could we design similar incentives in other markets?
