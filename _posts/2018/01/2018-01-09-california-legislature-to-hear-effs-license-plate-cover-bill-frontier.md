What? 

> Across the country, private companies are deploying vehicles mounted with automated license plate readers (ALPRs) to drive up and down streets to document the travel patterns of everyday drivers. These systems take photos of every license plate they see, tag them with time and location, and upload them to a central database.

I run blocking software on my computer to protect my privacy, but I didn't realize that the fact that I have a garage is also a privacy tool! I have read in the past about cities using license plate readers and city wide camera systems to track people, but I had no idea this was happening in the private sector too.

There seems to be an obvious sabotage opportunity here to have a magnetic license plate cover that is unreadable or deceptive to these systems that you can use while not driving. ðŸ¤”
