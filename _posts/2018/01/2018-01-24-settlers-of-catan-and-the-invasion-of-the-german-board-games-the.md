These strategy board games pulled me into some casual board gaming over recent years. Specifically [Carcassonne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcassonne) and [Ticket to Ride](https://www.daysofwonder.com/tickettoride/en/). Additionally strong digital versions of those games also make them very approachable and expose them to a new market. Starting with digital and then getting the actual board game has been pretty common for me.
