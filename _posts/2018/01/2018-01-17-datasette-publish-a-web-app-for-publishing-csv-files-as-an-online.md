I love what Simon Willison is doing here with Datasettes. He's focusing on making it super simple to take any file in a CSV format and make it available on the Internet in a public JSON API. He's now made a publisher so you can put data out there with **no technical backgroun** at all! Very nice! 👏 This should be a great thing for some of the open data initiatives out there.
