Lovely! 👏 I like how they show the transcripts of previous discussions.

> Spamnesty is a way to waste spammers' time. If you get a spam email, simply forward it to sp@mnesty.com, and Spamnesty will strip your email address, pretend it's a real person and reply to the email. Just remember to strip out any personal information from the body of the email, as it will be used so the reply looks more legitimate.
