The title of this article did make me chuckle along with the hip-hop inspired pull quote:

> If this is the case, then social media executives are simply following the rule of pushers and dealers everywhere, the fourth of the Notorious BIG’s Ten Crack Commandments: “Never get high on your own supply.”

It is worth noting, in a sector that is so proud of dog fooding their own products, why don't the leaders of these companies use them? I do believe and I think the evidence is clear that these products are designed to be addictive, but I don't think that is why executives at social media companies don't use their own products. More likely they are just busy and social media just isn't that important.
