Best HomePod writeup Iâ€™ve read yet. Sounds like it will have amazing sound, but disappointing that so much is still in the works. Not even multi speaker support is available now? And not supporting multiple iCloud users is a bummer. Iâ€™m hoping that a HomePod would use a voice signature to know all users in our iCloud Family account and bring the right data and interactions to each. Guess Iâ€™ll have to keep waiting. ðŸ˜•
