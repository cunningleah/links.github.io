This could be summed up with a simple "Remember all the indirect costs too!". The premise is solid, make sure you don't get fooled by the direct expenses of serverless and forget the other items. However, there is a flaw that the author doesn't factor in the costs of running the node.js comparable system. So, if labor is free maybe, but that is far from the case.
