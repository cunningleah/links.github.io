[Julia Evans](https://www.jvns.ca) with a very good overview of how they have deployed [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io) at Stripe. Her words of caution are true for many technology patterns:

> If you’re considering Kubernetes, keep in mind: don’t use Kubernetes just because other companies are using it. Setting up a reliable cluster takes a huge amount of time, and the business case for using it isn’t always obvious. Invest your time in a smart way.
