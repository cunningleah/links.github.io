üëç Very cool! I use [Duck Duck Go](https://duckduckgo.com) as my default search engine on all of my devices and I love this new addition. Now not only do you have a privacy forward search experience, but the services you visit from there will be privacy enhanced via this browser. I achieve something similar with a handful of plugins and content blockers. This is much simpler and is **privacy by default**.
