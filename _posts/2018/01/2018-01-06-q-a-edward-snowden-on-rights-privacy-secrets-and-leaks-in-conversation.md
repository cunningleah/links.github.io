Good interview with Snowden. I appreciate reading and hearing his opinions on these topics. I particularly like his view on protecting privacy.

> Privacy is the fountainhead of all other rights. Privacy is where rights are derived from, because privacy is the right to the self. Privacy is the right to a free mind. Privacy is the ability to have something, anything, for yourself, for you.

It pains me a bit when [Julian Assange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_Assange) and Snowden are bucketed together. I believe Assange is a crypto anarchist. Snowden I believe is actually operating on a defined set of ethics and trying to fix something that he clearly saw as wrong.
