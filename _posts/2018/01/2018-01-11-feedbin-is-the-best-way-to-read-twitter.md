Innovative new feature from [Feedbin](https://feedbin.com), which is what I use for my RSS feeds. This is an interesting gap filler for some source that may publish on Twitter but may not publish RSS. I don't think I would consider using it as an alternative timeline, and don't think you should use timelines anyway.
