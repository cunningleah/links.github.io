I've never used Chrome for privacy reasons, it’s too closely connected to the worlds largest advertising platform with a huge profit motive to collect information. Chrome was the last browser to support [Do Not Track](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_Not_Track) while it prided itself on supporting new capabilities before everyone else. Now Google has tied Chrome even closer to it’s services. If you want private browsing Firefox is a good bet with enough extensions, and Safari does more to fight privacy invading trackers than any other browser out of the box. Matthew Greene has a more [direct reaction to this, and is done with Chrome](https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2018/09/23/why-im-leaving-chrome/).
