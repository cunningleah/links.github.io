The comprehensive review of watchOS 5. This hits on all of the improvements. I was eager to try the Walkie Talkie app and initial impression is cool, but I would only use that with close friends and family. I tried it with my brother and we found it geeky fun. I tried it with Tammy and she looked at me like it was the dumbest thing sheâ€™d ever seen. Your mileage may vary. ðŸ˜œ
