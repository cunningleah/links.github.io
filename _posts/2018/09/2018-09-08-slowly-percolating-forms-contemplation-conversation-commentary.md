Forwarded to me from my friend [Nick](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nick-swenson-976b7337/). I like this way of thinking about learning topics.

> â€¦ if we don't do our own contemplation and commentary, we abdicate a good deal of our involvement in our own learning, and we shift from being fires to vessels.

I like the qualification of speeds (quick, slow) to various aspects of the process.
