What a cool project -- making a very low-tech, carbon neutral website. "This is a solar-powered website, which means it sometimes goes offline." The website shows its current battery level. 

> Our new web design addresses both these issues. Thanks to a low-tech web design, we managed to decrease the average page size of the blog by a factor of five compared to the old design – all while making the website visually more attractive (and mobile-friendly). Secondly, our new website runs 100% on solar power, not just in words, but in reality: it has its own energy storage and will go off-line during longer periods of cloudy weather.
