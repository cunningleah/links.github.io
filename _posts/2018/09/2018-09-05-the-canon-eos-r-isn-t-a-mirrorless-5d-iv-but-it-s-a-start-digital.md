This is the first new Canon camera that has piqued my interest in years. For sure mirrorless is the way to go for cameras, but after you have a full-frame sensor like I do on my now ancient 5D Mark II you really don't want anything less. This camera looks really great to me, despite the somewhat tepid review. Plus you can continue to use your existing EF lenses with an adapter. ðŸ“·
