This is a great example of innovation enabled with API's. I've been a YNAB user for a long time now, and this contest they made for people to build with it is a great idea. I downloaded [Allowance for YNAB](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/allowance-for-ynab/id1422989571?mt=8) right away -- itâ€™s great! In fact, I had written my own Workflow to do what it does, but it does it way better. Nice!
