Interesting reflections on the different definitions of the role of a Product Manager, along with links out to a number of other articles on the topic. No great conclusion, the role will be different based on company, product, market, etc. The main takeaway I have from this is to know that the title can mean so many different things, and that it can’t mean all these things or you can’t possibly succeed.
