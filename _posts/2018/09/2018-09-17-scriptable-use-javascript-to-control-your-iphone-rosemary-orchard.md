Very cool new app built for Siri Shortcuts in iOS 12. This is like the companion app to Workflow, now Shortcuts, but this one uses JavaScript. You can do an incredible amount with this, but the barrier to entry is higher since you have to know how to code. Shortcuts is very approachable, but a little less powerful. This is a good app to keep an eye on, especially as a community of scripts build up around it.
