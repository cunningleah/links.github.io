This data is much more divided than I would have thought. 

> Occupations are strongly sorted by ideology. Political scientist Adam Bonica has produced reliable and consistent estimates of ideological placement for a huge number of individuals, politicians, and organizations.

I wonder if these patterns were present much longer ago, 1950's for example.
