This seems like an incredibly bad decision on Google's part.

> When the hearing before the Senate Intelligence Committee began on Sept. 5, a black leather chair reserved for him sat empty next to Dorsey and Sandberg. A place card marked “Google,” in front of a blank notepad and muted microphone, served as a blunt reminder of his absence.

Giving congress the ability to get pictures of an empty chair with Google's name in front of it was foolish.
