Like Ben Brooks I use [1Blocker X](https://1blocker.com) on all of my iOS and macOS devices. I love how powerful it is and that I can create my own custom blocker rules. I've tried [BlockBear](https://blockbear.com) but haven't used it a lot. I like Brooks' recommendation of steering less technical users to that one.
