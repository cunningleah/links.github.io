I buy into this approach a lot. Tammy and I use YNAB to track our personal finances and we enter each transaction by hand. I avoid payment methods that are too convenient. I refuse to use the scan to pay features at coffee shops because I know it takes you further from the decision to spend money. ðŸ’¸ Some things should not be low friction. Thought experiment, I've often wondered what if you set your password as a trigger. So, on Amazon if you set your password to "DoYouReallyNeedToBuyThisStuff?" would that trigger your mind to reconsider?
