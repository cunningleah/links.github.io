In 2008 Apple acquired [P.A. Semi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P.A._Semi) for $278 million. Apple has also [acquired](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_mergers_and_acquisitions_by_Apple) a handful of additional semiconductor companies and they are now one of, if not the, most advanced chip manufacturers in the world. The Neural Engines **5 trillion** operations per second is enabling a local approach to machine learning that is very different than everyone else's. 

> Core ML, Apple machine learning framework, apparently runs some nine times faster on the A12 Bionic, which should mean there's more performance on tap for developers to put AI abilities into their apps.

That is also aligned with the core value of privacy and keeping things local.
