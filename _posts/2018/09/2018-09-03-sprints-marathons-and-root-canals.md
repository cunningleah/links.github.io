This is how I tend to think about this type of team driven work in a product backlog. I like the name "sustainability tasks" and also agree with the sentiment that these may or may not appear in a backlog.

> Putting regular sustainability tasks into a calendar would just create noise. Putting sustainability tasks into a product roadmap has the same effect. Having a budget removes the pressure to plan, prioritise or estimate such tasks, and avoids the need to compare them to features that bring immediate value.

Allocating budget and thinking about sustainability as an investment criteria works well, and gives you a more direct way to think about that work. You may even change that investment rate from time to time.
