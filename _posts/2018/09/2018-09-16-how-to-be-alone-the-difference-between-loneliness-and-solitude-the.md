In our, in my opinion, over-connected world I often wonder if solitude is even a thing that exists.

> Loneliness is being alone — and not liking it. It’s a feeling.
> 
> Solitude is being alone — and content. It’s a choice.

We rarely have an opportunity to embrace that in our lives, unless we make it a priority to have it.
