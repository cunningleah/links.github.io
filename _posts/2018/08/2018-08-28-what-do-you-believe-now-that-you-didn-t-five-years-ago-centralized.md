There is much truth in this article, even though it’s a little hard for me to like it.

> What's more, consumers simply do not care. Users use. Only a small percentage have the technical sophistication to understand why they may want to preferentially use decentralized applications for technical reasons. Saying "It's like X, but decentralized", does not resonate, especially when the services are not as good. We had decentralized Slack way before Slack...yet there's Slack. You know it's bad when GitHub managed to recentralize an inherently distributed system like git. 

Unfortunately you could say the exact same paragraph and replace "centralized" with "private".

This article reminded me of one of my most memorable conversations I had with a venture capital friend, [Michael Gorman](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mbgorman/). We were talking about the Internet and I commented that "the Internet prefers decentralization". On one level, a very technical one, that is true. The Internet is a massively distributed system. It can suffer significant outages without having total network failure. But I was mistakenly extending that concept to things being built on the Internet. Michael replied that he saw nothing to support that, that the Internet was full of "winner take all" businesses, with complete centralization and not even room for a 2nd place. He was absolutely right.
