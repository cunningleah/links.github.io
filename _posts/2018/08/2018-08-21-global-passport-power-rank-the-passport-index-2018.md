I saw this article about [traveling the world](https://www.bucketlistly.blog/posts/how-to-travel-third-world-passport-thai) and it linked to this Passport Power Rank. I hadn't really considered this, but when traveling with some colleagues a while back one of them commented that a US passport comes with significant benefits. Turns out Singapore has the most benefits of all!
