Rosenthal's opinion on Chaos is authoritative, and he clarifies how it is not antifragility.

> Antifragile is a confused concept that ignores a wealth of knowledge we have about building and operating resilient systems. Chaos Engineering, by contrast, is a well-defined, pragmatic discipline for navigating complex systems. In my mind, they are quite far apart.

He's also no fan of Taleb's book.
