A great overview of the mess of junk put in most websites. 

> So, with an internet connection faster than I could have thought possible in the late 1990s, what’s the score now? A story at the Hill took over nine seconds to load; at Politico, seventeen seconds; at CNN, over thirty seconds. This is the bullshit web.

My personal sites have none of this. And this is why you must run software like 1Blocker. It’s not just about ads, it’s about all this bullshit.
