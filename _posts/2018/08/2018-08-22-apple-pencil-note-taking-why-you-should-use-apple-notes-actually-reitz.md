I have tried a surprisingly large number of iPad note taking apps to use with the Apple Pencil, and I agree with Reitz's conclusion.

> Apple Notes is hands-down the most well–designed, thought–through note taking app available for the iPad Pro. It is exceptionally well designed, and if you leave your preconceptions about what a note–taking app should do, I think you'll find yourself agreeing with me, once you give it a real try/chance. 

He didn’t mention it in his writeup, but Notes also does limited handwriting recognition as well, which allows searching of notes if your handwriting is legible.
