I have been running health checks for decades. BigCharts [server is happy](http://bigcharts.marketwatch.com/up2.aspx) is the first. MarketWatch [is also happy](https://www.marketwatch.com/up2.aspx). 

> The “health” of a process is a spectrum. What we’re really interested in is the quality-of-service — such as how long it takes for a process to return the result of a given unit of work and the accuracy of the result.

Getting more precise with checks, not simple up and down, is definitely a good improvement.
