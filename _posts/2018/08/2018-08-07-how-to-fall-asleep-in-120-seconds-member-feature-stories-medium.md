Training program used by Navy pilots to get sleep.

> After six weeks of practice, 96 percent of pilots could fall asleep in two minutes or less. Even after drinking coffee, with machine gunfire being played in the background.

I think the target audience for this training isn’t the average person. If you are a Navy pilot, you’ll do great. But there might be some good stuff to cherry pick for other people too.
