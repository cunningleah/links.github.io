Interesting perspective on the critical role that code reviews play in establishing the culture of a team and for individual team members to learn. I would be very skeptical of a manager being the one to do the code reviews, but I do think it makes a lot of sense for managers to stay engaged in the process and participate so they can steer the other aspects of the organization that are impacted by code reviews.
