Note who is missing from this? Google. It makes total sense that Apple and Microsoft would be working to commoditize the lead that Google has in base map data. I also found it interesting that Apple is participating in this, but I don't think they are donating their new base map data they are sourcing themselves. Map data is a strategic advantage for a number of services.
