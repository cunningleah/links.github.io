Critical and deep review of OmniFocus 3. I agree with much of this review and my use case for OmniFocus is complicated, similar to Gabe’s. I have not seen the stability issues he references. I do agree that we are still waiting for the other half of the change with OmniFocus for the Mac. I’m hoping Omni starts moving faster after getting all this infrastructure coding done.
