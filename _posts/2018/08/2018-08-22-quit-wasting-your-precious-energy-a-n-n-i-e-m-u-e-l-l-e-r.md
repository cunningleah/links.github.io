What a great essay from Annie Mueller!

> Energy is the currency of the universe. You donâ€™t do anything to deserve it and youâ€™re free to spend it however you want. I just want you think about it. What do you want? Is that what youâ€™re getting? What bargains have you made?

Energy is necessary for everything, just like time. Time without energy isn't worth much. ðŸ¤”
