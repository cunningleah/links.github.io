The scale of this effort at Netflix is amazing.

> Every day more than 1 trillion events are written into a streaming ingestion pipeline, which is processed and written to a 100PB cloud-native data warehouse. And every day, our users run more than 150,000 jobs against this data, spanning everything from reporting and analysis to machine learning and recommendation algorithms.

I haven't used [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org) but it looks really compelling. I like how Netflix is using them for the exploration, as well as putting them into production pipelines.
