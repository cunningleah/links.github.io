I first logged onto IRC via EFnet in 1991. I had no idea it was only created 3 years prior. IRC was one of my first introductions to the world of the Internet and chatting with people around the globe. I called #macintosh and #root home, and had ChanOps in both of them. It was such a fun time back then. I love that IRC is still kicking. Itâ€™s the IndieWeb to Slack.
