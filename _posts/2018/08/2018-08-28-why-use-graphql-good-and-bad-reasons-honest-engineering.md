The capabilities related to **complex schemas** and **microservice orchestration** are the most compelling justifications for GraphQL. If I were doing more with mobile, I can see how the mobile use case is very helpful. I agree wholeheartedly on the assessment that REST v. GraphQL is a silly debate.

> GraphQL and REST are both very different things, GraphQL is a language and a technology, REST is an architecture pattern.

Yes.
