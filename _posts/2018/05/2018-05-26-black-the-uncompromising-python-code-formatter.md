Nice utility that will take your Python and format it in a very precise way.

> Black is the uncompromising Python code formatter. By using it, you agree to cede control over minutiae of hand-formatting. In return, Black gives you speed, determinism, and freedom from pycodestyle nagging about formatting. You will save time and mental energy for more important matters.

I like almost all of it but I find the closing bracket "dedenting" odd.
