New subscription service from Amazon.

> After signing up for the service, you'll create a profile for your child to ensure they get the books best suited for them. Books you're offered are based on your kid's age, and all of the titles are handpicked by Amazon Books editors.

Once Amazon knows your kids and their ages (plus whatever other data) they can also market you with all sorts of other parent purchases.
