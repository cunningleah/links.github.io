This is amazing! 🤟 My metal residency lies squarely in Thrash Metal according to this map, and some side trips to Industrial Metal. 🎧 That makes sense with Speed Metal and Original Hardcore Punk being the contributors to Thrash. Independent of the content this is incredibly well done way to present a complex topic. I love how it embeds YouTube videos for the songs too. Also note how time is represented so well! 👍👏
