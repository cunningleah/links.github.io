Om has the depth and breadth of experience with the web to provide this perspective. This is a good reason to opt out of “Big Tech” and it’s optimized engagement and seek out personal websites with their quirky and unexpected. I do believe that some feeds, ones that are not machine curated and in time order are fine for efficiency. For me Feedbin is that central place that connects me to the broad web. No ads or engagement metrics to satisfy, because I pay a small annual subscription for the service.
