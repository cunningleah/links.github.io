This is a long article from Krebs but it’s a great read on the real world activity happening behind net neutrality. Additionally, I feel like legislative activity in this area shows the most direct line to lobbying and money-driven votes.

> So the carriers are already reneging on their promise to customers that they won’t share location data without customer consent or a court order. But where does that leave us on net neutrality? The answer is that the major wireless carriers are already doing what was expressly prohibited under the FCC’s net neutrality rules: Favoring their own content over competitors, and letting companies gain more favorable access by paying more.

The data that we transmit when we use our mobile devices and broadband services is immensely valuable in the market. Unless legally blocked, this data will be sold. And the sellers and buyers have no interest in your privacy or anything else about protecting you. This is the same argument I often make online with free websites like Facebook. Here I find it more appalling because we all pay, in some cases a lot, for these services! We should have an expectation of privacy.

> When I first saw a Carnegie Mellon University researcher show me last week that he could look up the near-exact location of any mobile number in the United States, I sincerely believed the public would be amazed and horrified at the idea that mobile providers are sharing this real-time data with third party companies, and at the fact that those third parties in turn weren’t doing anything to prevent the abuse of their own systems.

So the tinfoil hat people saying that our mobile phones are being used to track us everywhere are right. And it turns out most people seem to not care or not understand.
