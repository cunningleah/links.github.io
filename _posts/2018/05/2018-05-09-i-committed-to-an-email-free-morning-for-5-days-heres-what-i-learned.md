This is **exactly** me. 🤦‍♂️

> Full disclosure: I don’t do morning routines. The only thing I do every day is groggily roll over in bed when my alarm goes off and check my email. According to everything I’ve ever read on the subject, it’s just about the worst thing you can do for your productivity–and I was starting to feel like those articles were right.

I've done that for 15 years or longer. I've done that for as long as I can remember waking up. And like the author, I know that isn't a good thing. Good read to encourage considering a change of habit.🤔
