Another data point on the [Manager v. Maker time](http://paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html) topic. I like that this article has some survey data as well, and allows for a hybrid. My main takeaway from these is that being deliberate about your time is important. Manage and plan your time to align with your objectives for each day.
