Interesting study suggesting the ads become less effective when people understand the data tracking informing the ad. As I read this I wondered if this is maybe the same part of our decision process that turns people away from foods that have “imitation” or “artificial” prominent in the packaging. Do we see overly complex delivery systems as not being genuine?

Also, I’m so tired of ad industry representatives justifying a complete disregard of privacy and intrusive surveillance tactics under the guise of “people want **relevant** advertising”. This is a poorly formed bit of verbal jujitsu to get us to try and think people want to be surveilled?
