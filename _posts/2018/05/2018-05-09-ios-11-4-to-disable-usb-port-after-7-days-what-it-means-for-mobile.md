This seems like a way to keep an entire array of security vectors away from iOS devices:

> The functionality of USB Restricted Mode is actually very simple. Once the iPhone or iPad is updated to the latest version of iOS supporting the feature, the device will disable the USB data connection over the Lightning port one week after the device has been last unlocked.

Big win for securing and protecting your data. 👏
