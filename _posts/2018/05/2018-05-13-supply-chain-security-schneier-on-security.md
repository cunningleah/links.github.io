Schneier does a good job of illustrating just how hard (maybe impossible) it is to insure that the software-based devices that run much of our infrastructure and services have not been tampered with for security purposes. One of the very believable items shared in the Snowden papers was that the NSA can install a backdoor in US-made network gear before it is sent overseas. There isn't a clear answer to this issue.
