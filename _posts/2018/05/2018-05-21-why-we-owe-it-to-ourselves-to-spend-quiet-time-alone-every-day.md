I can attest to feeling this and know many friends, particularly technologists, who do as well. I've referred to this as "digital fatigue" in the past.

> The destruction of our inner selves via the wired world is an even more recent, and more subtle, phenomenon. The loss of slowness, of time for reflection and contemplation, of privacy and solitude, of silence, of the ability to sit quietly in a chair for fifteen minutes without external stimulation â€” all have happened quickly and almost invisibly. 

I believe this is part of the reason people are seeking out practices like meditation in seemingly larger numbers than the past.
