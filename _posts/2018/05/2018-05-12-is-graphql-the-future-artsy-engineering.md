A call to consider GraphQL in a bigger-picture context.

> It lets you model the resources and processes provided by a server as a domain-specific language (DSL). Clients can use it to send scripts written in your DSL to the server to process and respond to as a batch.

I hadn't considered the connections the author is making here, but they seem valid and extend the way you can build on GraphQL in very novel ways.
