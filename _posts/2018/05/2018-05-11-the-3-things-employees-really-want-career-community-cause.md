I like the easy to remember "C's" in this article and can see that being a good way to communicate to your team as well as when hiring. Organizations and leaders should have solid, clear messages on all three of these.

The discussion about Millennials to me feels off though. I would suggest the weighting of different values is more connected to where a person is in their lifespan, not about the generation of their birth. Cause, which I would suggest is closely connected to the "Why?", grows in importance with age. I believe that's true for Baby Boomers, Gen X/Y and Millennials.
