An attempt to coin a word to refer to the act of deleting or expiring content on third party platforms. I've tried to do this on Twitter for a while using [TweetDelete](https://www.tweetdelete.net), which never seems to get tweets deleted for me anymore. Itâ€™s an interesting concept but I would always assume that nothing is deleted. All of these third party platforms may hide the content, but they certainly don't delete it.
