I believe that sharing a sincere Thank You with individuals at your office can be very impactful. I've received some, and it always generates a very positive feeling in me. I try to write them to individuals, but writing them can be hard. This article is specifically about writing a Thank You note for a gift, but I think the learnings can apply to a note to a colleague as well. üéÅ

This article also highlights how poorly I executed the Thank You cards I sent when I graduated high school. I put all the gifts in a AppleWorks database, and then used mail merge to print them on my dot-matrix printer. To make it even worse, I actually put "Thank You for the $20." if people gave me cash. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
