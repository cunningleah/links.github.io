Pretty accurate description of some of the promises of the Internet and the reality. 

> This great leveler of opportunity has resulted in some of the most overweening monopolies the world has ever seen. This medium of unfettered self-expression has delivered oppressive surveillance and invasions of privacy of a kind that were previously the sole preserve of police states. This enabler of a better informed, more engaged citizenry has instead come to be seen as subverting democracy itself.

This article advocates to being more social science to the technology of the internet. It certainly can’t help, but it’s hard to see how that is going to address the advertising biased attention economy.
