I can see the potential for this type of benefit.

> I find the practice of long-form journaling helps my brain to organise itself and tell me how it really feels! … My journal is where I get the chance to sit down with my brain and let it talk to me, to write/type whatever I”m feeling at the time. 

I've never stuck a journaling habit, but it’s one I'd like to build at some point.
