Thoughtful writing on opting out of social media entirely.

> Iâ€™m out. There are many things I hope to do while I am aliveâ€¦ trying to convince somebodyâ€™s advertising algorithm to pay attention to me is not one of those things. Multiply this conviction by the sense that spending time on social media is a suboptimal use of time that comes at the expense of things I truly care about and leaving seems evermore desirable. Just one life to live: I refuse to be a collateral pawn in someone elseâ€™s attention war.
