I’m sticking with [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) as my editor of choice but it is interesting to read about [Atom](https://atom.io/) and it’s model for extensibility. I agree with this writeup about [BBEdit](https://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/). It is historically great, but if you don't know it I don't think I would be investing in learning it due to the lack of extensibility. ⌨️
