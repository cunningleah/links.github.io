☕️ Very nice overview of coffee fundamentals.

> I thought I’d put together a “back to basics” guide on coffee brewing. We’ve certainly covered this topic in a number of ways, so think of this guide as a compilation/remix of all that information.

I would agree with everything in here. It doesn't address the next level topics on espresso, but this is a good starter for doing coffee well.
