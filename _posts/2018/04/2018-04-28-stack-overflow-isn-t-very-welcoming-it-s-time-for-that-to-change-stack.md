Even in my casual use of Stack Overflow I have come across some of the abrasive culture items noted in this post from their EVP of Culture and Experience, Jay Hanlon. This is a good statement of the problem and where they are starting. The whole time I read it I kept thinking how incredibly hard it is to build community on the Internet. Your average community in the real world seems to trend to nice, but online seems to trend the other way.
