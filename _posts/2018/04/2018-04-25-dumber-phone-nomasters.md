I have long advocated that you need to be very conscientious of the applications that you put on your phone. Those applications are with you all the time. Be mindful of that.

> Smart phones are useful, but they are also incredibly addictive, and that addiction is at the epicenter of Silicon Valley’s effort to grab an ever increasing percentage of our minds. In that a substance or behavior controls us, it becomes our master, and that just won’t do.

I like many of the recommendations made in this article.
