Great article highlighting the challenges between vertical and horizontal alignment of work. One view of DevOps would leave no central service to manage processes. This is maybe okay in a very small organization, but fails very quickly. Another view suggests everything should be done horizontal via SOP and escalations, completely devoid of the benefits of DevOps thinking. The right answer is to do a bit of both, and take the best parts of each. That is possible.
