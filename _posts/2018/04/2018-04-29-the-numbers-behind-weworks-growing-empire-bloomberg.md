This doesn't read like a healthy company. CEO Adam Neumann has 65% of the voting shares, and in the last two years has paid $9.8 million in leases to properties owned by officers and affiliates of the company, with $90 million in future lease payments. Meanwhile the companies costs are rising faster than revenue. 220,000 members with 251,000 desks? I would think they would have more subscribers than desks.
