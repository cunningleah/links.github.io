I like the stated goals of incident management: Short, Unique, and Never Forget. I've seen many incident management processes and I don't know that many of them state their goals up front. They are often assumed. They also enumerate the strategies for those goals: Engagement, Communication, Coordination, and Memorialization. I like the clarity of goal versus strategy. Often times communication is stated as a goal, not a strategy, of incident management. üëç
