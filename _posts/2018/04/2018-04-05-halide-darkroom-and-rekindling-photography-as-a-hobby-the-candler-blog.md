I've been slow to adopt RAW photography on my iPhone, even though I did **all RAW** photography on my Canon 5D Mark II. I didnâ€™t realize how well Halide and Darkroom were working together. I bought and setup both of them and love the power it gives me on my phone. Beware though, fiddling with RAW photos eats up battery quick.
