I like the simplicity of this app. I have long felt that I should be using [Little Snitch](https://www.obdev.at/littlesnitch) to keep applications on my computer from doing things I don't like. Little Snitch is really complicated though, and Radio Silence has a much simpler interface. Iâ€™m giving this a try on the free trial.
