I have had the pleasure of meeting [Peter Stern](https://www.linkedin.com/in/iampeter/) on a few occasions. We first met when he was CTO of Datek, which was one of the early firms to bring trading to the masses, and also one of the first customers of BigCharts. Even after Peter and team sold Datek to Ameritrade, I had the great pleasure of having dinner with him in New York. Peter has a mind that devours any topic in front of it. This letter he wrote for his daughter recommending the book Sapiens by Yuval Noah Harari is a strong recommendation, but not just of this book.

> History, philosophy, religion, biology, economics, linguistics, law, evolutionary biology, behavioral economics, topics I donâ€™t even know how to explain. Tens of thousands of pages I read. Many of these books were unrewarding and were left on a stoop before you were born or simply tossed. The ones that are worth reading still line our bookshelves, with a few exceptions. Some books were really good, but your mother found their titles upsetting, awkward, or difficult to explain to guests. Those also got left on stoops. Sorry about that. You can ask me about them if you really want to know. 

This is a recommendation to be a lifelong learner and to always be curious.
