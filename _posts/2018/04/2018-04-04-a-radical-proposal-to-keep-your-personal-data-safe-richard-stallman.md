I really want to like [Stallman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman)'s perspective on privacy, but I find his positions to be disconnected from reality. I once got the opportunity to have lunch with Stallman when he was in Minneapolis and I asked him how his positions extended to services over the web. He flatly just said he doesn't use them because itâ€™s not free open source software. I insist that there must be a position in the middle, as Stallman's view is not workable.
