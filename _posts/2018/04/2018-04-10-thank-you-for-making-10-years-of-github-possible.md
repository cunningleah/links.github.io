This is a fun reflection on the first 10 years of GitHub.

> For 10 years, you’ve shared, tinkered, and built on GitHub from all around the world. Before we head into the next decade, we’ve collected some of our favorite moments and milestones—just a few of the ways you’ve pushed software forward.

The impact that GitHub has had on open-source, and coding practices in general is amazing. There are many services that exist today that would not if [git](https://git-scm.com) and GitHub were not created. Let's hope that GitHub stays in good hands.
