Cloudflare continues to impress me and I love what they have done with this new DNS service. A long time ago I used OpenDNS but stopped using it when I realized they were selling data on your DNS queries. You should know that your ISP is doing that already. Comcast is looking at DNS queries to profile the services used in your house and then target advertising to you. Using a safe, secure and private DNS service is a very good idea. üëè
