Remember, Instagram == Facebook.

> Most Instagram users are unaware of all this. The service is widely seen as an escape from Facebook, so Instagram has to tread carefully to protect the app’s reputation.

If your concern with Facebook is privacy, Instagram isn't a place to solve that. If your issue with Facebook is something else than maybe it’s fine. I'd recommend using something like [micro.blog](https://micro.blog) to publish your own photos.
