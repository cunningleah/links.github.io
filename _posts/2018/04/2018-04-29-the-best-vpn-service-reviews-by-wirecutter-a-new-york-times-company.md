[VPN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_network) services used to be the domain business alone but with more focus on privacy, less trust of the providers that bring us our connectivity, and more security issues I know a lot of people are buying their own VPN services. This is the most comprehensive and researched view of VPN services I've seen to date. I personally use [Enrypt.me](https://encrypt.me) which is bundled in with [Eero Plus](https://eero.com/plus), but I have had a number of issues with it.
