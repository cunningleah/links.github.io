ðŸ”’ Interesting that bad actors are using silly social games to collect information on people that can then be combined with compromised passwords to answer security questions! Personally I always fill these security questions with random words, generated by [1Password](https://1password.com) and stored there. I use words since you sometimes have to speak these over the phone. Never share the same answers, and they are random.
