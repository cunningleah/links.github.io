I know a lot of people that worry about Facebook but don't seem to worry at all bout Instagram. Remember, Instagram is owned by Facebook. Use at your own risk. I won't use Intagram as their Terms of Service take ownership and give them all rights to repurpose all of your photos for any use they want, including selling them. Gross.
