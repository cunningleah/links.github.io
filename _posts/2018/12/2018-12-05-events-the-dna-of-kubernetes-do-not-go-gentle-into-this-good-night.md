Very approachable read on how Kubernetes handles internal communication. 

> Event-driven design has many more advantages and can address a lot of problems in distributed systems (back-pressure, queuing, retries, scale-out, etc.). However, itâ€™s not a new idea. Not at all! For example, relational databases work the same way (transaction log). The database is said to be the (stale) cache of the immutable log ðŸ˜„.

Neat! ðŸ¤“
