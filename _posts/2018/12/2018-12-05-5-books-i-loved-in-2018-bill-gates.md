[Educated](https://www.gatesnotes.com/Books/Educated) has shown up on a lot of book lists. I’m not sure about the Harari book. My book club read Sapiens and liked it, but then read followup materials that suggested it was not sound science. It’s crazy to me that I’m a [Headspace](https://www.headspace.com) subscriber but didn’t know that there was a book!
