This talk doesn't actually identify itself as [GTD for Teens](https://gtdforteens.com), but it is given by one of the authors of the book. As a Twin Cities resident I was also surprised that I had no idea there was a [TEDxEdina](http://tedxedina.com) event just a few miles from my house. I also didn‚Äôt know that [Mark Wallace](https://about.me/MarkBWallace#!), one of the GTD for Teens authors and a speaker at this event lived in the Twin Cities! I watched this talk with my teenage daughter and it sort of interested her, but not enough for me to light a shared spark of GTD-ness yet. üßê
