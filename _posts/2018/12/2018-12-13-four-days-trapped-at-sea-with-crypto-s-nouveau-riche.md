Crypto-currency boat cruise? No thanks.

> I understand why people might want to hire a boat and stuff it with investors: to make money. This cruise measures its takings in old-school pounds and dollars. None of the shipâ€™s bars take bitcoinâ€”fittingly, the only thing you can do with it here is gamble. What I donâ€™t understand is why anyone thought this would make the whole thing look less like a Ponzi scheme with a sleazy post-cyberpunk aesthetic.
