I like Thompson's take on current affairs.

> This, then, is the state of technology in 2018: the enterprise market is thriving, and the consumer market is stagnant, dominated by the “innovations” that a few large behemoths deign to develop for consumers (and probably by ripping off a smaller company). Meanwhile a backlash is brewing on both sides of the political spectrum, but with no immediately viable outlet through competition or antitrust action, the politics surrounding technology simply becomes ever more rancid.

The stagnation is a real thing. We don't have many new service and apps coming to market in the last year. The giants of the industry haven't left much for the rest of the market.
