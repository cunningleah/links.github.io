I’m a huge fan of [Glengarry Glen Ross](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glengarry_Glen_Ross_(film)). I've probably seen that movie 30 or more times. Not just the scenes that everyone talks about, but the whole movie. It turned me on to [David Mamet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Mamet) and his [amazing dialogue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Mamet#'Mamet_speak'). This Christmas version of it is absolutely hilarious, and done by Alec Baldwin himself. Point of trivia, this scene with Alec Baldwin is one of the most quoted of the entire movie, and it didn’t exist in the original play. It was added for the movie rendition to give additional punch.
