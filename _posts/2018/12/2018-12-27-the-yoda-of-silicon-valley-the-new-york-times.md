I love that [Knuth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Knuth) got such an expansive writeup in the New York Times. He's a pioneer and someone that all of us in the computing field should admire. I have the first three volumes of [The Art of Computer Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Art_of_Computer_Programming). I'll admit I've not read them, but I love that it is titled Art, as that is what programmers should strive to create. Link from my friend [Michael Rock](http://mrock911.com).
