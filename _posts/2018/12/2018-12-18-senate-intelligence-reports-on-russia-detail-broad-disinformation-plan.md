Instagram doesn't get the focus that Facebook does regarding potential misuse, but it should. And please remember, itâ€™s all just Facebook since they bought Instagram.

> The new research also points to the previously underappreciated prominence of the IRA's use of Instagram. It notes that IRA posts on the photo-sharing platform received 187 million engagements, which dwarfed the 76.5 million engagements that IRA posts received on Facebook.

That's pretty amazing engagement.
