In 2009 I wrote a blog post on what [Microsoft could do to get "nerds" back](https://www.thingelstad.com/2009/my-solution-for-microsoft-to-get-nerds-back/). I should have titled it "geeks", but oh well. One of the two suggestions was to stop working on their own web engine, at the time Trident. It took 9 years, but Microsoft has announced they shifting their browser engine. Just one thing left, although you might argue that Windows Services for Linux is pretty close to the other recommendation I had.
