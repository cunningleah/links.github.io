Interesting analogy from Cal Newport. Is the open web more of a market based system? I can see the logic behind that, and it does make sense.

> As any serious blog consumer can attest, a carefully curated blog feed, covering niches that matter to your life, can provide substantially more value than the collectivist ping-ponging of likes and memes that make up so much of social media interaction.

This is why I don't get any of my incoming information via social media. None of the links I highlight come from social media.
