it’s nice to see employees at one of the biggest technology companies in the world organizing and getting a voice on matters like this.

> More than 20,000 Google employees and contractors in Google offices located in 50 cities worldwide walked out for real change at 11:10am local time protesting sexual harassment, misconduct, lack of transparency, and a workplace culture that doesn’t work for everyone.

It’s a good trend.
