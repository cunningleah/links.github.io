Most of this is not all that interesting except for people that are into Omni and their software. However, the part where they talk about building a "headless" version of OmniFocus that runs on the server and handles the API connections from OmniFocus for the Web made me do a double take. I can’t tell if it’s novel and interesting, or downright crazy!
