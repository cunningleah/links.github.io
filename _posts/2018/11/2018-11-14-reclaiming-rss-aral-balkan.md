Another call-to-action to support some of the original plumbing of the web around syndication. I found the term **surveillance capitalism** novel here. I do think that using the term surveillance as opposed to privacy is a good idea. People seem to not value their privacy, but they don’t want to be surveilled. I’m a big fan of RSS and highly recommend [Feedbin](https://feedbin.com) for anyone looking to get their content direct, with no algorithms and surveillance in the middle.
