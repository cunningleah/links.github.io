The new iPad Pro's look amazing. I do the majority of my computing on an 11" iPad Pro at home, and a 12.9" iPad Pro at work. I've already pre-ordered the new more compact iPad Pro for the office, and Iâ€™m ready to upgrade at home and am considering going for the larger one as well. The previous 12.9" with itâ€™s large bezel and weight was just too big, but this new one looks very compelling. Iâ€™m wondering if I couldn't do with one of these instead of a laptop at home. The fact you can plug a monitor into the USB-C port is pretty compelling as well for photo editing. ðŸ¤”
