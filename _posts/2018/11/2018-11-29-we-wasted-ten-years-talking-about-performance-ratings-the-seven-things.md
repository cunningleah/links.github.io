Like this perspective on performance management systems. Things of note:

1. Curious to see [BetterWorks](https://www.betterworks.com) highlighted. They seem to show up in this topic more than most. Noting to look into their solutions more.
2. The feedback topic highlighted is a component of why I've been pushing to provide more structure and guidance to the 1:1 functions in our teams. There is an incredible amount of time and investment in 1:1's, and I think many of them do not have clear goals and objectives.
3. I like seeing OKR's highlighted here. 
4. I like the way this framed the engagement topic, and how a manager should think about team engagement in their overall work.

Good things to consider as your organization evolves and grows. Via [Juselly French](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jusellyfrench/).
