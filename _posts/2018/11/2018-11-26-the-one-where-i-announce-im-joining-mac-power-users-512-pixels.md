I listen to Mac Power Users from time-to-time and it’s funny — I got the sense that Katie Floyd was less into the content in recent episodes, or something was off. It didn’t surprise me to hear that after.a **10 year** run she's stepping aside. I think it will be interesting to see if the podcast gets some new spirit with a new cohost.
