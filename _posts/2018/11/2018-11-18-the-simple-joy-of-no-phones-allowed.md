Even the crowd’s milling around and chatting between acts was so much more lively. People were either talking to their neighbors, or taking in the room. And everyone taking in the room was taking in the same room. It felt great. 

I had heard that Jack White did this for his shows and I have want to go just to experience it, plus the music is great.
