I think people have heard this advice before but itâ€™s worth repeating, as it still catches everyone off guard.

> What I wish I knew was that if youâ€™re an early company employee, itâ€™s not likely that the skills you have on day one are the skills needed as the company scales to the next level. This sentence is worth reading multiple times as no one â€“ not the person who hired you, the VCâ€™s or your peers -is going to tell you when youâ€™re hired that the company will likely outgrow you.

If you want to read a whole book on this topic pick up The Leadership Pipeline where it highlights that you need to be very thoughtful when you move into a new role, specifically on what you are going to **stop doing**, so you can be successful. By the way, sometimes the stuff you may need to stop doing is stuff you really like.

Iâ€™ve personally done an annual inventory every year for the last twenty years or so where I try to objectively ask myself what I need to start or do more of than Iâ€™m doing now, and what I need to do less of or completely stop doing. Companies, successful ones at least, grow much faster than the talent in them often can. By willfully giving up things and reassessing your own skills to the organizations needs, you stand a much better chance of continuing to stay relevant in the organization. ðŸš€
