In computer science, BNF (Backus Normal Form or BackusNaur Form) is one of the two main notation techniques for context-free grammars, often used to describe the syntax of languages used in computing, such as computer programming languages, document formats, instruction sets and communication protocol; the other main technique for writing context-free grammars is the van Wijngaarden form.
