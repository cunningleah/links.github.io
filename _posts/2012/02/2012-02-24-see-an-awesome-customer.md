The second reason you start a toy company is to make the world a better place. OgoSport was founded on the premise that if we created great and unique active play toys, it would help reverse declines in play and would bring families together. So we were thrilled to see the pictures of OgoBild POD on CTO and creative dad Jamie Thingelstad’s blog (yes that’s his real, awesome last name).
