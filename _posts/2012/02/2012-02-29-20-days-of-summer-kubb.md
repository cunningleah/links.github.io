KUBB is one of the fastest growing games in the U.S. KUBB is a cross between bocce ball and horseshoes but with variations to make the game more interesting and challenging. Unlike those games, KUBB can be played in the snow. The game KUBB (pronounced koob) is addictive, employs skill and strategy and has sometimes been called The Viking Chess Game.
