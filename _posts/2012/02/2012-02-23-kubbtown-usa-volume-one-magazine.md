“I have big plans for Eau Claire,” said Eric Anderson, coordinator of the U.S. National Kubb Championship in Boyd Park on July 17. What’s that? You’ve never heard of kubb and don’t even have any idea how to pronounce it? You must not have made Anderson’s acquaintance yet. He is more or less (but mostly more) responsible for kubb’s infiltration of the Chippewa Valley. He’s passionate about kubb and wants to make it a part of our daily lives.
