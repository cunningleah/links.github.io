I have big plans for Eau Claire, said Eric Anderson, coordinator of the U.S. National Kubb Championship in Boyd Park on July 17. Whats that? Youve never heard of kubb and dont even have any idea how to pronounce it? You must not have made Andersons acquaintance yet. He is more or less (but mostly more) responsible for kubbs infiltration of the Chippewa Valley. Hes passionate about kubb and wants to make it a part of our daily lives.
