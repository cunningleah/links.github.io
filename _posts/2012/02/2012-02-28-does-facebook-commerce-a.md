But just because F-commerce has had a few stumbles, it's too soon to be writing its obituary. Wade Gerten, CEO of social shopping software vendor 8thBridge, which created a Facebook store for 1-800-Flowers in 2009, was quoted in a Bloomberg News article about the topic, but then said his quotes were taken out of context. To clarify, he wrote in a February 17 Forbes blog post: "The Bloomberg article and others like it were correct to say Facebook stores have not sold millions of orders. However, they failed to articulate what the REAL opportunity is for social commerce."
