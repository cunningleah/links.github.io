Useful.  <blockquote> I get asked about Amazon Web Services pricing literally every day. I suppose its a factor of the job Im in! The AWS Simple Calculatorshould come with a health warning for anyone who is not already an AWS expert, and the EC2 Pricing page is a resource I personally go to a lot, but its not a quick reference. We do a good job in CloudVertical(signup for a free trial) of helping Cloud users understandtheir costs but in terms of just putting together basic, high-level indicative costs for a solution  there isnt really a simple at a glance solution. We do TCO (total cost of ownership) models for customers all the time, and we may launch a public, automated shopping cart style TCO and Cloud On-Ramp Calculator in the near future (hint!), but in the mean time, heres a cheat sheet(PDF) I put together to help with basic, quick, cursory AWS pricing. </blockquote>
