This seems like a smart idea that many organizations could emulate.

<blockquote>
37 works in a deceptively simply manner: an executable (bin/37) parses out subcommands, which map to a single script in the repos libexec/ directory. This gave convention to our scrappy outfit of battle-hardened shell scripts. No longer were they to be randomly named misfits! They each now were subcommands of 37, organized and named by a convention of libexec/37-SUBCOMMAND. Our first recruits were 37 console, 37 sftp, and 37 scp, and many more subcommands have been drafted since.
