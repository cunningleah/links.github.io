This looks like a really great way for kids to ride along. Seems more comfortable and definitely safer for little ones than a standard 3rd wheel bike. This might be in the works for Tyler next year.

<blockquote>
That night, however, the husband had a dream of what it would be like to explore the valley with his family--by bicycle trailer.  Before his feet even hit the floor that next morning, he grabbed the hotel notepad and sketched his idea for the trailer.  Once the family arrived back home in Denver, the cars in the garage were replaced by welders and benders.  Several months later, that notepad sketch was turned into a real, working model of the Weehoo iGo bicycle trailer.
