I can't wait to highlight to some of my nerdy friends that like to bug me for the alternative port that I run SSH on, that is also the one highlighted in this smart blog post.

If youre anything like me, you probably log in and out of a half dozen remote servers (or these days, local virtual machines) on a daily basis. And if youre even more like me, you have trouble remembering all of the various usernames, remote addresses and command line options for things like specifying a non-standard connection port or forwarding local ports to the remote machine.
