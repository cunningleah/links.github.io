My session for Agile Day Twin Cities 2012.

<blockquote>
Product teams that ship great software time and time again take the concepts of agility much deeper than just project frameworks. In this discussion we will explore the learning processes that effective teams inside of startups as well as larger organizations use to get to market. The depth and breadth required of all members of the team are wider than they have ever been before, and adopting a culture of learning and experimentation along with accountability will deliver better short and long term results.
