The Papofoxtrot Space Series, by London studio Postlerferguson, are wooden toys that simply dont feel like wooden toys. Modeled after some of our most advanced satellites, from U.S. spy gear to the solar systems most advanced telescope to a machine that will incinerate trash in our atmosphere, maple and stainless steel combine to create beautiful high-tech models unlike any aesthetic out of NASA.
