Three years ago this December, I sent an email to my fellow Googlers, attempting to pin a clear definition on a term being batted around quite a bit: Open. I was concerned that within our walls it meant different things to different people, and that too many Googlers didnt understand the companys fundamental commitment to the merits of being open. Referring to the two prongs of open technology and open information, I outlined our underlying ethos of transparency. Pursuing open systems, I argued, has led and would continue to lead to two desirable outcomes: Google gets better and so does theworld.
