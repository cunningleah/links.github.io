About six months ago, we started working internally on our "beyond Scrum" campaign to improve agile software development so that it works in a cloud-based world. As noted in my article, 7 Things I Hate About Agile, I dont agree with Scrum, the dominant agile methodology. I was called everything from "ignorant youngster" to bitter old man to a Moron with a capital M. However, the response was big. 50,000 people read the article. 1200 signed up for a Beyond Scrum webinar that we did with Perforce. Its clear that a lot of people are ready to move on to the next step.
