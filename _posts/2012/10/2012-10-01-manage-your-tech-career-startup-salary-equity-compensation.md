Cool data visualization. The actual data in these things is always a bit arbitrary, but like the visualization.  <blockquote> Today, Wealthfront is launching a Startup Compensation Tool to help our clients with that part of their financial lives: their careers. The Tool offers data on the tech startup job market, including cash compensation and equity packages for a range of jobs, so that you can maximize the return on your career. You can embed the Tool by using the toolbar at the bottom. </blockquote>
