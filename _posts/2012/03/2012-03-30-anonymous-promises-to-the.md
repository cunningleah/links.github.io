Anonymous seems to get attributed with potential threats more than they are real threats. This attack on root name servers is a known limitation on the web. I'm skeptical this is real, but the tactic makes sense.

<blockquote>
A new message posted on Pastebin and attributed to the hacking group Anonymous promises to shut down the entire internet on March 31. The group says that it will target the 13 root DNS servers that make up the bulk of the servers that give URL names to most of the Internet.
