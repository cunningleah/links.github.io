I recently attended the Summit Series event near Lake Tahoe. The event had about 600 people, rich content around entrepreneurship, science, and art and music/dancing at night - a pretty solid mix. I had an amazing time, was inspired from the moment I got there and met the most incredible people. All throughout the event I was interested in understanding what makes this event work and what makes it different. This was my first Summit, and prior to the event I noticed that there was a lot of unusual excitement around it. I was wondering what al the hype was about and what the hell was I getting into.
