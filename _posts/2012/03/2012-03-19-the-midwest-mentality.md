While traveling around Chicago, the conversations I have with people are generally routine. I ask them about Chicago, what startups I should see and if they see anything wrong with the technology ecosystem. They answer my questions, then parlay with the question of what Ive observed so far while being the reporter-in-residence for the total time of two weeks. We go back and forth over the issues I bring up, and then finally, they admit that all of the failures and successes of Chicago tie back to one concept: The Midwest Mentality.
