Twenty five days before my father died, on my birthday exactly six years ago, he gave me a present. He had the sparkle back in his eyethe one that had been reduced by pancreatic cancer to an ashen emberwhen he gave it to me. It was a small package, rectangular in shape, in crisp brown-paper wrapping. Twine neatly wrapped around the corners, crisscrossing back and forth arriving at a bow crafted by the sure hands of a man who built his first model airplane at age seven.
