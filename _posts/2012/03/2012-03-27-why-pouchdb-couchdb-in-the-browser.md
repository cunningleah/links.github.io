Seems a little crazy, and I question the longevity of CouchDB, but interesting.

> PouchDB is a Portable CouchDB, it is a near complete implementation of Apache CouchDB that runs natively in the browser using IndexedDB as its storage mechanism, it has the same data model as CouchDB, the same conflict resolution and most importantly, it replicates with CouchDB.
