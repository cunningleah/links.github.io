Poor article about discounting one myth (home ownership) with another myth (build a startup and get rich).

> Two things:If you are about to do a startup or if you are in the middle of startup-phase then you definitely cant afford to waste the time or money to buy a house for reasons I explain below. Second, when you sell your startup everyone wants to buy a house with the proceeds. Dont. Its just part of the American mythology.
