The new terms put a much stronger emphasis on how Pinterest can commercially use the information you post on the site. Specifically, Cold Brew Labs (owner of Pinterest) says it is changing its terms to spell out that Pinterest does not have the right to sell your content  something it says it never intended to do in the first place.
