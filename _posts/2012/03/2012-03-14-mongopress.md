MongoPress is an instantly scalable, incredibly flexible CMS that uses MongoDB and PHP to deliver a powerful object-oriented environment that is flexible and free. It is not only freely licensed and distributed under a generous GPL license, but it is also free from the constraints that many of the leading MySQL-based CMS platforms suffer from. MongoPress was in many ways inspired by WordPress, and was originally planned as a plugin, but after realizing that WordPress had been built from the ground-up as a table-based MySQL-driven architecture, providing MongoDB support was not going to be an easy task, and in some ways, even seemed to defeat the point of a NoSQL environment.
