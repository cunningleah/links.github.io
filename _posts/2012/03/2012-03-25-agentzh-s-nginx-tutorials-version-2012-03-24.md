Closest thing to a book on nginx I've seen.

> I've been doing a lot of work in the Nginx world over the last few years and I've also been thinking about writing series of tutorial-like articles to explain to more people what I've done and what I've learned in this area. Now I have finally decided to post serial tutorials to the [Sina Blog](http://blog.sina.com.cn/openresty) in Chinese. Every article will have one rough topic and will be in a rather casual style. They're not parts of a book after all. But I do have plans to re-orginaize these stuffs to form a real book.
