It appears that Wikimedia is going to get very serious about data. Wikidata looks at first blush to be building on the amazing capabilities of Semantic MediaWiki and creating something very similar to Wikimedia Commons but for data. This is exciting on a number of levels.

<blockquote>
Wikidata aims to create a free knowledge base about the world that can be read and edited by humans and machines alike. It will provide data in all the languages of the Wikimedia projects, and allow for the central access to data in a similar vein as Wikimedia Commons does for multimedia files. Wikidata is proposed as a new Wikimedia hosted and maintained project.
