Atheists rank highest in "Disapprove if my child wanted to marry".

> But first, consider this data published by Penny Edgell and her colleagues in the American Sociological Review. It reveals that Americans believe that atheists, more than many other groups, are not likely to agree with their vision of American society. Atheists topped the list, beating out the second contender, Muslims, by 13 percentage points. Likewise, among the types of people Americans would not want their children to marry, atheists come first, beating out Muslims (again) by 14 points and African Americans by a full 20.
