Looks like a Javascript framework to allow multiple Javascript applications to communicate through a message mechanism in the web page.

> Backplane Protocol lets trusted apps share information. When placed together on a web page, Backplane-compliant applications share user identity and other information, seamlessly, regardless of their source. Explained another way, Backplane Protocol is a secure framework for interaction between multiple, independent client- and server-side parties in the context of a browser session. In essence, Backplane Protocol defines a message distribution system where messages are delivered securely, reliably, in order, and in real time. When a user takes action in one app, the other apps will get the news from Backplane.
