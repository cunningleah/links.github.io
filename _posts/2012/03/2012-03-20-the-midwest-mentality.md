While traveling around Chicago, the conversations I have with people are generally routine. I ask them about Chicago, what startups I should see and if they see anything wrong with the technology ecosystem. They answer my questions, then parlay with the question of what Iâ€™ve observed so far while being the reporter-in-residence for the total time of two weeks. We go back and forth over the issues I bring up, and then finally, they admit that all of the failures and successes of Chicago tie back to one concept: The Midwest Mentality.
