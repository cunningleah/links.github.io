Mid-Continent Railway Historical Society--also known as Mid-Continent Railway Museum--is an outdoor, living museum and operating railroad recreating the small town/short line way of life during the "Golden Age of Railroading," spanning the years 1880-1916, with operating trains, educational exhibits, and displays of restored rolling stock. Mid-Continent has operated at North Freedom, Wisconsin since 1963.
