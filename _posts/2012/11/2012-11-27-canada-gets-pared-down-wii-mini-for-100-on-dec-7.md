Ugh, I'd buy one of these if they sold it in the US!

<blockquote>
Nintendo's main focus right now may be on the newly launched Wii U, but that doesn't mean the company is ignoring the console's predecessor. Today, Nintendo announced the Wii Mini, a $100 black-and-red redesign of the Wii that will be sold exclusively in Canada, of all places, on December 7.
