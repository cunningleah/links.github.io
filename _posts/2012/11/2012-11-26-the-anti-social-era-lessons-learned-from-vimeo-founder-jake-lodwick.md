Jake doesnt let people interview him these days, but lucky for you hes my cousin. So Im going to go ahead and recount some of the best lessons that I have learned from one of the best product creators in the Webs nascent history. Am I totally biased? Absolutely. Hes my cousin. But he may still be pissed at me, because I didnt tell him I was doing this.
