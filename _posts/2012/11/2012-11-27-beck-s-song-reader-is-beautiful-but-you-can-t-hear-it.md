Jay Troop in this video is my former boss Kathy Yates' son. Very cool.

<blockquote>
Song Reader, the latest album from Beck, isn't easy to listen to. Why? It's available exclusively on sheet music. This struck fans (and us) as incredibly annoying at first--especially those without any musical ability. But once we laid our eyes on the stuff, we were sold. In order to hear the song for ourselves, we reached out to a New York City based band, named Contramano, to record "Old Shanghai," a song from the album.
