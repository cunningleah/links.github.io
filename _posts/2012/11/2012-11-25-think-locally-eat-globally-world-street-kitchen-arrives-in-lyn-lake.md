Cant wait to visit!

<blockquote>
Good news for fans of Bangkok Burritos and YumYum Rice Bowls! You don't have to wait until next spring for the World Street Kitchen food truck to make its lunchtime appearance in downtown Minneapolis. Both of those signature dishes will be featured daily at WSK's new bricks and mortar restaurant at 2743 Lyndale Ave. S. The new venture from brothers Sameh and Saed Wadi, owners of the acclaimed Saffron restaurant in the Minneapolis warehouse district opens officially on Monday, but Carol and I got a sneak preview last Wednesday.
