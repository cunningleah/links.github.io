<blockquote>
Im looking to hire an iOS Prototyper for one year. This is a full-time, 1-year contract. You must be in Chicago. Pay starts at $100,000  Im all ears if you want to make an alternate pitch. After the year is up we may decide to work together some more, but thats a discussion for another time.
