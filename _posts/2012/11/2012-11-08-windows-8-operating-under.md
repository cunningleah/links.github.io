I've sat down in front of Windows 8 on a computer (not a tablet). I was completely sober and had many of the same confusing incidents that this woman did.

<blockquote>
Following the release of Windows 8, we wasted no time in trying out Microsofts new operating system on a drunken subject. Jennifer, a 40-year-old mother of 2, is an active consumer of PCs, software and alcohol. She agreed to sit down with us the afternoon following the products launch to share her thoughts on Windows 8, all while imbibing several rounds of her favorite tequila.
