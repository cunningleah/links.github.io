Greenland is, by area, the world's largest island, yet with a population of under 60,000, it is the least densely populated dependency or country in the world. In May 2011, Ben Saunders, Martin Hartley and Alastair Humphreys spent 14 days in Greenland on a training expedition. This was preparation for their expedition in Antarctica next year.
