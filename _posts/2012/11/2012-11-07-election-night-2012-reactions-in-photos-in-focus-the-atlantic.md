An amazing collection of photos showing the contrasts of winning and losing.

<blockquote>
Late last night, as the outcome of the presidential election became clear, supporters of Barack Obama celebrated his victory, as his challenger, Republican nominee Mitt Romney, conceded the race and offered his congratulations. Obama won the popular vote by more than 2.5 million votes, and took the electoral vote by 303 to 206. Supporters of both candidates rode an emotional rollercoaster last night as results were slowly reported, ending in disappointment for some, elation for others, as Barack Obama now heads into a second term as President of the United States. Collected here are images from yesterday's election, from here at home, and abroad.
