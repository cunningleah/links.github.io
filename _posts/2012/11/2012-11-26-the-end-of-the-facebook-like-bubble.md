And it appears brands need to recalibrate their Facebook approach. According to a new study by GroupM, theres been a 38 percent decline on the reach of brand pages. While 14 percent of users saw an organic post pre-algorithm change, it dropped down to 8 percent after the change. In short, Facebook cut the reach of brands that dont pay up. And theyre not used to these types of ultimatums.
