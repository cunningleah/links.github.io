Dumbo is a project that allows you to easily write and run Hadoop programs in Python (its named after Disneys flying circus elephant, since the logo of Hadoop is an elephant and Python was named after the BBC series Monty Pythons Flying Circus). More generally, Dumbo can be considered to be a convenient Python API for writing MapReduce programs.
