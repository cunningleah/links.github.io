Seems like a very solid concept.  <blockquote> CareWire is a patient engagement solution that utilizes automated text messaging to increase billable appointment yield, visualize patient satisfaction in real-time, and improve provider profitability. Interactive text messages are delivered to patients in precisely timed sequences to prepare patients for upcoming appointments and procedures. </blockquote>
