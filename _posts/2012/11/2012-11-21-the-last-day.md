The chairs were gone now, so he sat on a desk. One of the company stickers they had handed out at the launch party was stuck to the side, and he slowly picked at it, the glue sticking to his fingernails. He thought about how it wasnt supposed to be like this. Every day the tech blogs screamed about fundings and acquisitions. The entire valley was a dream machine where nobody worked, because everybody was too busy crushing it. Nobody ever talked about the emptiness of failure. Nobody ever told him the hockey stick of user growth might look more like a baseball bat laying in an empty field.
