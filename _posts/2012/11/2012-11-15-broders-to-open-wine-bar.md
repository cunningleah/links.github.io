This is great news! Am sad to see Pierre's close though.

<blockquote>
It didnt take long for the former Pierres space to find a new tenant, and its a familiar one: Broders. Owner Molly Broder said she planned to open a wine bar in the small 50th and Penn building next spring with a casual food and wine menu similar to the patio menu at Broders Pasta Bar, as well as a selection of tap beers. Well keep you posted on any updates both on the home page and, especially, in Tuesdays edition of The Tap.
