Revered game designer Jordan Mechner built his first game, Karateka, on an Apple II in his Yale University dorm room; it was released by Broderbund Software in 1984, during his sophomore year. Nearly three decades later, Mechner led a small team called Liquid Entertainment in developing a remake of the 8-bit classic.
