Interesting to see WordPress using Bitcoin. Ry4an now has a place to spend his vast reserve! :-)

<blockquote>
Bitcoin users of the world, unite! Or rather, unite around the fact that you can now buy WordPress upgrades via the digital cryptocurrency. WordPress has announced that it will now accept payment for its digital goods in Bitcoin, in addition to credit cards and PayPal.
