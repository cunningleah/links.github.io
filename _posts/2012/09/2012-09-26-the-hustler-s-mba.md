As someone that didn't finish college I can read this with a little smugness. I went to college for 3 years, and while I didn't get the degree I did get immense benefit. Access to computers science labs, the Internet and fellow techies was key. These days that access is a lot easier to get.

The key point though of this article I can't really agree with. There are many careers that cannot be self learned (example, integrated circuit design).

Plus, let me go on the record against this term "hustler" as it applies to startups and business. It's a short road from there to huckster.

<blockquote>
That's not to say that school has no benefits whatsoever. It does, and although I left with zero additional skills after my three semesters there, I had a good time and benefited from the social aspect. The problem is that you can't just compare college to doing nothing at all. You have to compare it to what you COULD have done.
