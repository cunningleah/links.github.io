A good article reviewing the approaches for dealing with different device pixel densities. I've been reading through this to "retina optimize" some of my websites.

<blockquote>
Mobile devices are shipping with higher and higher PPI, and desktops and laptops are following the trend as well. Theres no avoiding it: High-pixel-density, or Retina, displays are now becoming mainstreamand, as youd expect, our websites are beginning to look a little fuzzy in their backlit glory. But before we go off in the knee-jerk direction of supersizing all our sites, we must first identify the problems ahead and figure out the most responsible way forwardkeeping our users in mind first and foremost.
