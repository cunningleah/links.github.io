Fun story. Makes me feel good about my Sandisk Ultra cards.

<blockquote>
39-year old John Noerr discovered a Canon XT in a small creek near Pharaoh Lake in theAdirondacks, and thanks to a surprisingly hardy memory card and some serious detective skills, he managed to trace the camera back to its original owner. The memory card still had almost 600 images on it, many from a city that Noerr guessed to be New York.
