Looks like this will finally be an enjoyable theater to go to!

<blockquote>
Gone are the old seats, now replaced with more spacious seats and two-person sofas. Also gone is the old projector which was swapped out for digital equipment. And there's a new screen which is 40 percent larger than the previous one.
