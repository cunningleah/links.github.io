Amazing looking waterfall with very cool lava columns. Need to put this on the list for the 2nd visit.

<blockquote>
Svartifoss (Black Fall) is surrounded by the dark lava columns that gave rise to its name. The hexagonal columns were formed inside a lava flow that cooled extremely slowly, giving rise to crystallization. Skaftafell National Park, Iceland.
