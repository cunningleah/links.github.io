Great tip if you use these two utilities, which I do.

<blockquote>
1Password bookmarks are now indexed by Launchbar and you can now securely login on your websites through the app without filling in a username or password. Just imagine no more opening your browser, typing the address and clicking on that 1Password icon in your browser. None of that. Just a couple keyboard strokes and youll be logged in. Too good to be true? You better get used to it! Heres how you set it up.
