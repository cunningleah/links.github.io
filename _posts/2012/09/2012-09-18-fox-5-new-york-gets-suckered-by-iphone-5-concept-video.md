Laser keyboard? duh!

<blockquote>
Unfortunately, that video clip is the work of Aatma Studio; it's a year-old concept video, showing an obviously misshapen iPhone 5 and several hypothetical new things it could do. (The studio's current concept clip is a winner, including the Rubberband Electronics killer feature.) Seems like the fact-checking squad is out of the office today -- they might have pointed the editor to an actual Apple video of the phone, for instance.
