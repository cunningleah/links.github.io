These assumptions also underlie the oft-cited intention of waiting for the $1 cables/adapters. But, recall that Apple specifically said that Lightning is an all-digital, adaptive interface. USB3 is not adaptive, although it can be called digital in that it has two digital signal paths implemented as differential pairs. Remember, the SlimPort designers put a few simple digital signals on the connector and converted them  just a cm or so away  into another standards differential wire pairs by putting a chip inside the plug.
