We've discussed creating something like this for Minnebar. I think it's a good idea.

<blockquote>
The Drupal Code of Conduct (http://drupal.org/dcoc) outlines our shared ideals and values. This document expresses how we hope to make these ideals real at our conferences and other events. Our goal is to ensure that all participants can freely and openly share ideas in a friendly, safe, and welcoming environment that encourages and inspires mutual respect and collaboration.
