I really like what Mozilla is doing with these little projects to make web authoring super easy for everyone.

Thimble makes it ridiculously simple to create your own web pages. Write and edit HTML and CSS right in your browser. Instantly preview your work. Then host and share your finished pages with a single click. Easy, huh?
