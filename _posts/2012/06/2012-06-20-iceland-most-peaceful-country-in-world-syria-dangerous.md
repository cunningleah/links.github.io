Fun to be going to Iceland this September.

<blockquote>
Anyone seeking that elusive state of affairs known as peace on earth had better have an appetite for volcanoes, glaciers and hot springs. Iceland, the Nordic island with no standing army and the smallest population of any NATO member state, is the most peaceful country in the world, according to the annualGlobal Peace Indexcompiled bythe Institute for Economics and Peace.
