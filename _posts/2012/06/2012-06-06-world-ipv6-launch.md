All of my websites are already IPv6 ready. Sadly, I can't confirm that 100% since none of my common Internet access points are IPv6 capable.

Major Internet service providers (ISPs), home networking equipment manufacturers, and web companies around the world are coming together to permanently enable IPv6 for their products and services by 6 June 2012.
