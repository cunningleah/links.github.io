I'm very surprised, and pretty excited, to see that Reeder 3.0 for iPhone now supports Fever as an option outside of Google Reader! I've used Fever in the past, and really like it's capabilities and particularly like that it is self hosted but the iPhone front end was very problematic. Reeder is extremely slick and letting me use it outside of Google Reader is probably enough for me to go back to it. We need more diversity in RSS products and this is a huge step in the right direction. I'm assuming the iPad and Mac versions will soon support Fever backends as well.

The UI refinements also look great. I'm hoping that the "send to" services can be customized so I can include my link wiki.

<blockquote>
Version 3.0 of Reeder for iPhone is a major update. Not only are there a slew of new features, but there are an equal number of design improvements. The app has been completely re-written from the ground up and every corner of the UI has been refined. In short, Reeder runs better, looks better, does more, and is easier to use.
