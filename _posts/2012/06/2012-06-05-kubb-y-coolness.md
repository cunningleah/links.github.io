Great old school web page about Kubb.

<blockquote>
Kubb is a lawn game involving wooden blocks, dowels, and throwing things at your opponents...or at least at their blocks. It is an awesome game to play with groups as large as twelve, divided into two teams. The rules are surprisingly complicated considering it is a lawn game.
