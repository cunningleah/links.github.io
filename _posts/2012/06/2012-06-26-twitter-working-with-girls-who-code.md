All of which leads to our new partnership with Girls Who Code, a program founded by Reshma Saujani (@reshmasaujani), designed to introduce high school girls to software development skills. Through our investment of time, energy and money, we will be working with Girls Who Code to empower young women and provide them with the skills and resources necessary to pursue a career in engineering and technology.
