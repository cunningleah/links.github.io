Urban Kubb in New York on blacktop. Shame to play on blacktop, but I guess we play on ice here.

<blockquote>
Straight from Scandinavia, we're planning a new activity to help you pass the time in Bryant Park. This summer, we'll be offering Kubb on the lawn. If you've never heard of the game, don't fear. We'll also provide you with instructions and a proctor to teach lessons. We can already tell that this Viking Chess game will get quite competitive.
