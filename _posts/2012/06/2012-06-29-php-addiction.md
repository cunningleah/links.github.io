I wrote Tumblr, Instapaper, and Second Crack in PHP. I continue to use it because I know it extremely well, its very easy to use and deploy, and its nearly maintenance-free on servers. When youre a programmer forced to also be your own sysadmin, thats very attractive. But I hate it. Its limited, often clunky, outdated, and deeply flawed.
