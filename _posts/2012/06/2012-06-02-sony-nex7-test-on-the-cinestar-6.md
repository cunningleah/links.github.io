Amazing test video. Extremely stable aerial platform for video. This kind of thing being available at low costs is going to open up so many creative venues for people.

<blockquote>
A quick test flight with the Nex7 on our Cinestar 6 hexacopter to check for vibrations/moire/focus etc. I used the new Sony Nex7 with the 18-55 lens. This was shot at 1080 60P, manual at 1/125, f9, iso400, auto focus, WB at cloudy and Vivid for scene.
