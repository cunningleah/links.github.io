My friend Dennys got this jib and really likes it. The sample video he took is pretty incredible.

> A jib that would fold down to 42", support up to ten pounds of camera and accessories, have an over 8' height reach, and cost under $400 Sure, and you're still waiting for the leprechaun to train your unicorn. Until he does, there is the indiGO-JIB.
