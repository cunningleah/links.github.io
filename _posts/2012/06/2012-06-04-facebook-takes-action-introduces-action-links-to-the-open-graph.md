8thBridge developed an entire platform on Facebooks Open Graph that demonstrates what is possible with Action Verbs and Action Links. In the example below, you see the introduction of three new buttons, I Want, Love, and Own on the TOMS ecommerce site. Upon the click, an Action Verb update is sent to the users Facebook Newsfeed expressing the sentiment tied to each button. At the bottom of the update, friends are invited to add the item into their own bag trying social and ecommerce together through peer-to-peer influence.
