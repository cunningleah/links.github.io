Looks like a great reinvigorated coffee option in Roseville.

<blockquote>
J. Arthurs opened its doors in the Rice St. Plaza in July of 2008 to offer the community an independent coffee shop with a warm, comfortable environment and great meeting spaces. After 3 years in business, we have refocused our coffee ethos to have more of an artisan, handcrafted approach.  Joining forces with Dogwood and Roastery 7  two local coffee roasters  J. Arthurs upgraded equipment, changed styles of espresso, and committed to sourcing high quality, natural, local dairy. We are excited to explore this new world of coffee and hope that we can share this experience with the local community of Roseville and the surrounding metro area.
