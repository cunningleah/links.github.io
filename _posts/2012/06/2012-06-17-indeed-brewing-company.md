Another local brewery joining the renaissance of brewing here in Minneapolis.

<blockquote>
Beer. Its perfect, isnt it? Its the drink that stands equally well alone as it does when paired with onion rings or even a rack of lamb. It can be as lowbrow or pretentious as you want, but it always seems to be just what you need. One thing weve come to notice about beer is that it has some things in common with other classic beverages. For instance, discussions of wine might lead to mention of terroirthe taste of the land. We like to think great craft beer has terroir, too. The difference is, we dont talk with a ridiculous French accent. Instead, we offer you finely crafted beer in a humble, awesome, aluminum can. You with us? Indeed Brewing Company is situated in the heart of Northeast Minneapolisa location replete with rich local history and known for being the birthplace of Art-a-Whirl. Its inspiring for Indeed to be part of an area that has grown from immigrant stomping grounds to a place that hipsters call home, tipping back a glass of brew in the many pubs found here.
