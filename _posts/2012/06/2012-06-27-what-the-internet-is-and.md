Other mistakes we insist on making over and over. For example, thinking that: the Web, like television, is a way to hold eyeballs still while advertisers spray them with messages; the Net is something that telcos and cable companies should filter, control and otherwise "improve."; it's a bad thing for users to communicate between different kinds of instant messaging systems on the Net.; the Net suffers from a lack of regulation to protect industries that feel threatened by it.
