In college a CSci professor of mine once asked the class "What would you do if you had infinite CPU cycles?". This is the answer.

And to be clear, I think it's brilliant.

<blockquote>
A video uploaded by YouTube user streborhcaz has revealed a neat little detail in the new iOS 6 music app. The iOS 5 slider, pictured above, is just a static image. However, as you can see below, Apple seems to be using one of its movement sensors to detect when the phone is being tilted from side to side and adjust the reflection of the volume button at the bottom of the screen. Pointless? Perhaps, but thoroughly fun nonetheless.
