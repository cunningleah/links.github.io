Nice excerpt of some of Layne's photos in BirdWatching magazine.

<blockquote>
We had the pleasure of getting to know him personally in 2005, when he took the photos that accompanied Editor Chuck Hagners Nature Conservancy article about the Kirtlands Warbler's winter grounds on Eleuthera, in the Bahamas.
