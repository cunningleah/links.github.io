LLVM is an umbrella project that hosts and develops a set of close-knit, low-level toolchain components (assemblers, compilers, debuggers, etc.), which are designed to be compatible with existing tools typically used on UNIX systems. The name "LLVM" was once an acronym, but is now just a brand for the umbrella project. While LLVM provides some unique capabilities and is known for some of its widely used tools (the Clang compiler, a C/C++/Objective-C compiler that provides a number of benefits over the GCC compiler), the main thing that sets LLVM apart from other compilers is its internal architecture.
