Garrick and I have been talking about instrumenting a Kubb set with all sorts of tech and doing interesting things with it. He found this as an option to drill inside of a Kubb to try and see what data we would get. Wish they were cheaper!

<blockquote>
Priced at only $89, the X16-1C is a very economical data logger packed with exceptional features. The X16-1C implements a digital 3-axis 16g accelerometer with user selectable sample rates up to 200Hz. This simple device stores precisely timed acceleration data on the device for later viewing and analysis. Just plug it into any USB host and the X16-1C mounts as a USB Mass Storage Device (like a USB flash drive). Data is stored in plain text Comma Separated Values (.csv) files, ready to be imported into any spreadsheet, word processor, or end user application. The X16-1C options are set up easily using a simple text based configuration file.
