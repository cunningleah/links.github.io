Very fast to have a site up and running to see if your password was in the group lost. Checked, mine was lost. Changed password.

> We have some bad news. 6.5 million LinkedIn passwords (unsalted SHA-1 hashes) were allegedly leaked, and many of those have already been cracked. (See Chris's post for more info.) Some of us were victims, and we want to help you find out if you are a victim, too
