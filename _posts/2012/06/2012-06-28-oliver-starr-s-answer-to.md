Now for my own experience. Incidentally I weigh about 180 and have had a long career as an athlete. At the time of the attack I was in excellent physical condition and was definitely much stronger than an average person of similar size since my job was to train. Please note this is pulled straight from my notes/diary at the time of the incident. Apologies that it reads a bit like a story -- the facts and nature of the injuries should be clear enough.
