A bash implementation of the game of life. Awesome! I would love to put this on the LightBrite at CoCoMSP. Out of the box the script doesn't want to work well on my Mac (which has bash 3.2.48).

<blockquote>
This is a simple bash implementation of Conway's Game of Life. It uses textfile for the initial pattern state, where a dot (.) represent a dead cell and a X represent an alive cell. It's not high-performance code but it's a good proof of concept. Requires bash (version 3.2 or newer).
