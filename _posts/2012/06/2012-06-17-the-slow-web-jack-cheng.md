Interesting read and a powerful concept.

<blockquote>
Timehop and iDoneThis both help us remember and reflect, and this gives us perspective. It grounds us in the flow of time, or perhaps lifts us up above the treetops. iDoneThis is the only task management tool Ive come across with the potential to help you realize youre working on the wrong thing.Fast Web derives value from the just happened or the soon to happen. Slow Web unlocks value from deeper in the past.
