Good article about what Symantec is doing in the data backup space. Interesting that we have Symantic doing this on the established side, and CrashPlan (Code42) doing this on the startup level.  <blockquote> Silicon Valley's Symantec deals with the worldwide explosion of computer information at its Roseville outpost. </blockquote>
