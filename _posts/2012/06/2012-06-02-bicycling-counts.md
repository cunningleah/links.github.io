Great idea.

<blockquote>
Each day during Bike Walk Week the counter will be installed at a surprise location along a popular Minneapolis bike route. During the day, the counter will track all passing cyclists. Then each evening from 9-10 p.m., CEE will set up an artistic projection on site to display a real-time count of each person. The counts will translate the cumulative impact of individual financial savings, gasoline saved and environmental benefits to society through improved air quality and reduced healthcare dollars.The first installation will be set up on Saturday June 2nd at 9am on the West River Parkway bike path across from the Mill City Museum located at 704 South2nd Street Minneapolis 55401.
