Worth a bookmark just for that excerpt. :-)

<blockquote>
You may have read that I am technically signed on, by default, to be an executive consulting something or other - which is a relatively standard protective clause for a creator in my position. Guys like me cant actually just be shot and left in a ditch by Skynet, were still allowed to have a title on the things we create and help out, like, I guess sharpening pencils and stuff.
