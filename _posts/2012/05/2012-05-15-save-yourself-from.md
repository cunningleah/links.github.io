This detailed self-help article is humbly offered to people suffering from severe insomnia, in the hopes that my expertise and personal experience can be of some use to you. Before you place your hopes in any of my recommendations, however, please ensure that there is no medical cause for your insomnia first. That said, many severe cases of insomnia are basically bad habits, and will respond to behavioural conditioning123  and even if there is a medical cause for your insomnia, behavioural conditioning may still be your best defense.
