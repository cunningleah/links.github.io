These links will allow viewers to do specific tasks related to the post or app, and theyre not limited to Facebooks built-in action types  Read, Listen, and Watch. For example, you can now Fave this Product for a Fab.com post, which will add something you see on a friends feed to your own Fab.com list. Some other early examples include Save this Place on Foursquare and Save this Recipe for a cooking app. When you click the link, you will complete the action and also post a story on your timeline/feed/ticker telling all of your friends that you did so. That wont be annoying at all.
