Good talk that does a very good job of visualizing the problem of tracking and re-marketing online. This is the first example I've seen that hits hard on why this is a problem. The visual of the red dots is compelling and clearly shows people that this is a big deal.  <blockquote> As you surf the Web, information is being collected about you. Web tracking is not 100% evil -- personal data can make your browsing more efficient; cookies can help your favorite websites stay in business. But, says Gary Kovacs, it's your right to know what data is being collected about you and how it affects your online life. He unveils a Firefox add-on to do just that. </blockquote>
