Wiki that highlights some good places to watch planes at MSP.

<blockquote>
The observation deck which is now marked "Cell Phone Lot" is for those who are not able to get into the terminal. From here you can view 12R/30L operations as well as see planes parked at concourse G. You are also able to see one of the DELTA maintenance hangers. From Highway 5: Take the Post Road exit and follow it west past a Super America gas station. The parking lot is on the left. From I-494/Mall of America: Take the 34th Avenue exit towards the HHH terminal. Go past the terminal and take a right on Post Road. Spotter notes: There is a large blast fence which blocks the right half of the area. This place is fantastic when 30L is in use as you can get a decent shot of every aircraft landing or departing. When 12R is in use generally you will miss all of the landings as they tend to exit to the left off the runway before they come into a good view.
