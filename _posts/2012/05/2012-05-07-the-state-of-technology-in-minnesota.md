Last year saw larger venture capital financings go to health care IT players like RedBrick Health and Ability Network, as well as nanotech pioneer Cima NanoTech. We also saw $3 million to $10 million rounds raised by data, Web and commerce start-ups such as 8thBridge, OptiMine Software and Enstratus. The number of companies financed has also increased, with more than 60 firms raising money in 2011. More than half of these were funded as part of the Minnesota Angel Investment Tax Credit.
