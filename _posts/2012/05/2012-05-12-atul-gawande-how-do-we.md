Atul Gawande may be an alien dropped on the planet with ridiculous powers. I don't know that there is anything he can't do. Gawande for President.

<blockquote>
Our medical systems are broken. Doctors are capable of extraordinary (and expensive) treatments, but they are losing their core focus: actually treating people. Doctor and writer Atul Gawande suggests we take a step back and look at new ways to do medicine -- with fewer cowboys and more pit crews.
