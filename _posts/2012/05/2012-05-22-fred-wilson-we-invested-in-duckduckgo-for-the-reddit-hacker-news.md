Consider this a hedge in the Union Square Ventures portfolio. Smart move.  <blockquote> DuckDuckGo has seen incredible growth in the past few months, and it doubled traffic from 500,000 searches a day in December 2011 to 1 million searches a day by mid-February. Union Square Ventures is one of the few investors in the search engine. </blockquote>
