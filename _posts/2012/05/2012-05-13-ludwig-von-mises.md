von Mises is mentioned in Rory Sutherland's talk "Perspective is everything" and referenced as an influential thinker on the psychology of economics. Mentioned as a related thinker to Kahneman.

<blockquote>
Ludwig Heinrich Edler von Mises (September 29, 1881  October 10, 1973) was a philosopher, Austrian School economist, and classical liberal. He became a prominent figure in the Austrian School of economic thought and is best known for his work on praxeology. Fearing a Nazi takeover of Europe, Mises emigrated to the United States in 1940. Mises had a significant influence on the libertarian movement in the United States in the mid-20th century.
