Rory Sutherlands TED talks are awesome. All are worth watching. This one is no exception. This talk touches on many topics similar to the Thinking, Fast and Slow book I just read. After watching I found myself contemplating this talk in the context of things that I'm very familiar with. There is a lot to learn here.

<blockquote>
The circumstances of our lives may matter less than how we see them, says Rory Sutherland. At TEDxAthens, he makes a compelling case for how reframing is the key to happiness.
