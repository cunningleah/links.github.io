Exceptionally polished talk, even for TED. Fun though. I watch this and wonder if Brian Greene will be proven right. The idea at the end of a night sky dark as all the universe has expanded away is thought provoking, but incredibly depressing to consider.

<blockquote>
Is there more than one universe? In this visually rich, action-packed talk, Brian Greene shows how the unanswered questions of physics (starting with a big one: What caused the Big Bang?) have led to the theory that our own universe is just one of many in the "multiverse."
