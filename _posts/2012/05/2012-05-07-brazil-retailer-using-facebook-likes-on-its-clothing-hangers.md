The part missing from this is a QR code on the hangar that processes a Like action when you scan it. Surprising they didn't do that, not that hard to do. In general the idea of extending the digital world into the physical is something I like. This example too literal. Showing some derivation of raw data may be more compelling than a raw number and one metric.

<blockquote>
The store, C&A, is putting  real-time Likes counters on its hangers in retail locations around Brazil. The Like data is taken from C&As Facebook page, where the company has listed its various wares for people to interact with. When a person Likes an item, that Like shows up on the hanger. It is meant to help customers with purchasing decisions. If they are unsure of one item, they can see how many people online think the product is a good buy.
