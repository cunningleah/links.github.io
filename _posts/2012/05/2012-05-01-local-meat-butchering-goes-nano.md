Two things however make this project a possible industry game changer. The first is the cost. The Jeffries say the grand total will be about $150,000  including the costly machinery. While they admit some of the cost savings are because the family owns the land, has done much of the labor and drew up the plans themselves, the fact remains all signs say the project will be built for a fraction of the USDAs estimate.

Secondly, the family is also making the entire project open sourced  meaning that they are sharing every part of the project with the public and other farms wanting to do the same. Plans, videos and even a detailed budget can be found on Sugar Mountain Farms prolific blog and on the Open Source Ecology website.
