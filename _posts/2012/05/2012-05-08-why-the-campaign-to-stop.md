There is an alternative theory, one that has also been around for decades but that the establishment has largely ignored. This theory implicates specific foodsrefined sugars and grainsbecause of their effect on the hormone insulin, which regulates fat accumulation. If this hormonal-defect hypothesis is true, not all calories are created equal, as the conventional wisdom holds. And if it is true, the problem is not only controlling our impulses, but also changing the entire American food economy and rewriting our beliefs about what constitutes a healthy diet.
