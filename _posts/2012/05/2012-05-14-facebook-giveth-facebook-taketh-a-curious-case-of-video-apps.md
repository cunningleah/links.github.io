Something didnt add up and it wasnt till you see Socialcams popular and trending videos pages that you understand the full picture. These pages are full of videos of crazy Fox newscasters and other stuff, normally the preserve of YouTube. Many of these videos are actually from YouTube, though I am not certain how Socialcam is putting all those videos on their service. The Next Webs Drew Olanoffwent ahead and did a breakdown of how Socialcam is making it all work.
