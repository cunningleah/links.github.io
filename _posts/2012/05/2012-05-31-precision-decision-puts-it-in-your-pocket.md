This reminds me a lot of my "Everyday Monte Carlo" idea.

<blockquote>
The functionality of the program is quite simple. The user enters the options that they are considering (be it which car to purchase, which school to attend, etc.) and then enters a series of customized variables that play into that decision (cost, location, fuel mileage, etc.). Once these have been entered, the user rates each option on a 1-10 scale based on the desired criteria and then weighs each criterion  also 1-10  based on how important it is to them personally. Finally, a mathematical algorithm produces the best option based on that data.
