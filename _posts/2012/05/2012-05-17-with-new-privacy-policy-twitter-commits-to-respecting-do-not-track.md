I applaud Twitter for supporting DNT in a real way (not just window dressing).  <blockquote> Under a new policy announced today, Twitter will be suggesting accounts for Twitter users to follow based on data collected from an individuals browsing habits on websites that have embedded Twitter buttons. While this is sure to garner scrutiny from the press and public, Twitter is also taking a pioneering step toward respecting users privacy choices: it has committed to respecting Do Not Track -- a simple browser setting users can turn on to tell website they dont want to be tracked. </blockquote>
