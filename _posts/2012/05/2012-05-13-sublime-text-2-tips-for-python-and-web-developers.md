I keep hearing good things about Sublime Text 2. I may need to give it a go.

<blockquote>
Sublime Text 2 is a very powerful text editor which has gained popularity recently  for good reasons. It is commercial (59 USD). Plenty of power comes from the fact that Sublime has a plug-in framework built in Python. Even though the core app remains closed there exist a vibrant plug-in ecosystem around the editor.
