Pinterest is the new obsession, and their recent funding will further that along. It's a good reminder that after 9 months they had less than 10,000 users. Things start much slower than people really think. Also their "burn the boats" view is the main thing that kept them focused. In short, this isn't easy.  <blockquote> Pinterest looked like that in the beginning. After nine months, Silbermann said the site had less than 10,000 users and many weren't using it daily. "I sent Pinterest to 200 of my friends and I think 100 of them opened the email. It was catastrophically small numbers," Silbermann said. </blockquote>
