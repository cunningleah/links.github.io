We were bored. Really bored. So, Emilia, Nina, Susanna, Anna, and I decided to start our own newspaper! Instantly it was called The Teardrop Times. We drew, wrote, and typed (well, I did most of the typing) our hearts out until we had a good newspaper. But to save money the newspaper was in black-and-white, so we started a website. Our newspaper is for everybody, we want you to know that. On our website, you can see our work in color and comment about what you think of it! Enjoy our website!
