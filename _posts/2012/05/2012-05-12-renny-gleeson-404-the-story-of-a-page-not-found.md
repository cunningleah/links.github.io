Similar vein to the talk Garrick and I gave on Every HTTP Status code, but much better done. :-) He seemed to talk the point into a pretty philosophical place for the mundane 404 page, but nicely done.

Oops! Nobody wants to see the 404: Page Not Found. But as Renny Gleeson shows us, while he runs through a slideshow of creative and funny 404 pages, every error is really a chance to build a better relationship.
