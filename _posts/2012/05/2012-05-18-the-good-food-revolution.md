In the face of financial challenges and daunting odds, Allen built the countrys preeminent urban farma food and educational center that now produces enough vegetables and fish year-round to feed thousands of people. Employing young people from the neighboring housing project and community, Growing Power has sought to prove that local food systems can help troubled youths, dismantle racism, create jobs, bring urban and rural communities closer together, and improve public health. Today, Allens organization helps develop community food systems across the country.
