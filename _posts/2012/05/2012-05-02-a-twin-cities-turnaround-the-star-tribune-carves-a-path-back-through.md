The Star Tribune today, four years later, seems to have lifted itself off the endangered list  although, to extend the species metaphor, it still has work to do before its survival becomes a matter of Least Concern. Its out of bankruptcy; its debt has been reduced from around $500 million to $100 million. And, maybe most importantly, its growing its readership in print and through digital and keeping an eye towards growing consumer revenue.
