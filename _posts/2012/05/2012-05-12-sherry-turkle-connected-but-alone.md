Turkle's new book looks interesting and I feel a lot of truth in her points in this video.

<blockquote>
As we expect more from technology, do we expect less from each other? Sherry Turkle studies how our devices and online personas are redefining human connection and communication -- and asks us to think deeply about the new kinds of connection we want to have.
