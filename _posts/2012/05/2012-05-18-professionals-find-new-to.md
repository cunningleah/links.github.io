If you can have a discussion, or even utter coherent sentences, with another person while your spinning  your doing it wrong.

<blockquote>
But for those looking to sweat a bit more, spinning is the most popular corporate workout. The exercise takes place on stationary bikes and accommodates all ages and fitness levels. Everyone starts together and ends together, and works at their own pace. Yoga, Pilates and small group training are also popular.
