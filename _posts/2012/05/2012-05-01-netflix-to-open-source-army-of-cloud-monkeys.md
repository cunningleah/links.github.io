Over the next few months Netflix will release the source code for these programs and more, giving cloud developers a look at how it runs its services on Amazons cloud. The plan is to release pretty much all of our platform, including the Monkey infrastructure, over the rest of this year, says Adrian Cockcroft, the Director of Cloud Architecture at Netflix. We will be doing bits and pieces of it through the summer and into the fall.
