If America is ever to confront its obsession with guns, that time is now. Americas murder rate is four times higher than Britains and six times higher than Germanys. Only an idiot, or an anti-American bigot prepared to maintain that Americans are four times more murderous than Britons, could possibly pretend that no connection exists between those figures and the fact that 300m guns are out there in the United States, more than one for every adult.
