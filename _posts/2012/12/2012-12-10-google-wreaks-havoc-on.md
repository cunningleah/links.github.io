We run our company on Google Apps for Business, and weve never had any problems. Until now. On Friday morning we came in to work to find that all our calendars are completely, utterly messed up. Not only did we lose data and access to our own calendars, but there appears to be a major security breach as well. Were still coming to terms with what happened, and its hard to explain without getting into specific detail, so Ill just give you taste of the damage.
