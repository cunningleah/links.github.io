I got to spend an afternoon with Lucas in Iceland as he was wrapping up his trip there. He had done a workshop with Layne Kennedy. Great photos.

<blockquote>
Traveling the globe in search of untouched and remote places is what I do. I'm forever chasing the perfect wave, the perfect waterfall, the perfect image, and Land Rover helps me get there. Always pushing to get one step closer to the dream - but at the end of the day it's the journey and not the destination I remember.
