Lionsgate Academy is a public charter school with a mission to serve students with high-functioning autism in their transition years (grades 7 through 12). Our general education teachers, special education teachers, and therapeutic support service staff work collaboratively with our students and families to identify our students unique strengths and challenges. We strive to provide a well-rounded education for our students. In many ways, we function like a typical high school with core academic classes (e.g. math, science), elective classes (e.g. drama, art), and after school activities (e.g. music, automotive club, legos club). In addition to this, we have full support services and transitions teams on staff to provide necessary training in areas such as social skills, occupational therapy, speech-language skills, and transition skills (i.e., service learning, home living skills). All of our programs are designed to meet the unique needs of students living with autism spectrum disorders.
