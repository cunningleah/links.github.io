I have wondered many times about these Leica digital cameras. They cost a lot, and at least from this review it seems my Canon DSLR is a better place for me to stay.  <blockquote> The M9 is obtuse in other ways, too. It has almost no controls and zero convenience features. Many of its buyers probably demand that simplicity, so I cant fault Leica for that. But the M9 also has slow shutter response, a slow image processor, slow shot-to-shot time, poor battery life, and a small, low-resolution screen, even by 2009s standards. The 5D Mark II is luxurious, fast, and extremely responsive by comparison. </blockquote>
