Amazing espresso machines.

<blockquote>
The purpose of Slayer is to share information, stories, and developments from the world of professional espresso. We want to explore it all-the coffee, the Culture, the people, the equipment, technique, and philosophy, the things that define the world of espresso when it is taken to a professional level. We want to hear from those in the specialty coffee industry who may at this very moment stand at the top of their game with tremendous depth of experience and expertise. You may already have a creed firmly in place around your Art based on years of exploration and practice. We want to know how this is working for you-so we can learn from it.
