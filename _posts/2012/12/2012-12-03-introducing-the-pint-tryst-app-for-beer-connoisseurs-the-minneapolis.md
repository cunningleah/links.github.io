Not too long ago we reported on local GoKart Labs challenge to themselves, the GoKart 600, in which they were working to concept, design, build, and test a mobile app in a day or 600 minutes. From that they birthed "Pint Tryst," a digital diary of sorts that allows the user to log and rate the micro-brews that they loved and didn't care to keep track, share with friends, and get suggestions on new ones to try.
