Interesting idea. The goal here was to create something musical. I wonder if much work has done on making "audible graphs". Would strike me that your ear may be able to discern more data points in parallel than your eyes?

<blockquote>
Bass wobble - Notes based on smoothed out NASDAQ overall trading volumes. Wobble rate based on current volatility of the NASDAQ overall trading.
Melody - Apple performance vs NASDAQ100 index.
Basic beat - Static.
Hi-hat - Triggered when the overal nasdaq trading volume is above 2 minute rolling average.
