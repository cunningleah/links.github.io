Last Sunday morning I slept until my eyes were ready to open, rearranged my apartment, ate cake for breakfast, and read online news in total silence. I did two loads of dishes, went for a walk and a short longboard ride, returned library books, and watched bike polo in the park. I then found my favourite tree and sat under it to think about how amazing the previous week had been.
