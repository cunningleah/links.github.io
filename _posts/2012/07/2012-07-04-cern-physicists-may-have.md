I don't pretend to understand the significance of the Higgs but assuming this discovery holds this is pretty amazing.

Physicists working at CERNs Large Hadron Collider said Wednesday that they had discovered a new subatomic particle that looks for all the world like the Higgs boson, a potential key to understanding why elementary particles have mass and indeed to the existence of diversity and life in the universe.
