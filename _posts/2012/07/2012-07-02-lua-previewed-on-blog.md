The Berlin hackathon 2012 brought a record number of people together who worked together on many technical issues. Some people came to learn about MediaWiki, some came to learn about the finer points of Git and Gerrit. The great thing about MediaWiki hackathons is that typically there is a great mix of knowledgeable people, talented people and people who can explain and help with difficult technical issues. It is also where new technologies are previewed, this time it was Lua who was getting a lot of the limelight.
