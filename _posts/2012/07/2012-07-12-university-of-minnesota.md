The Growth Accelerator Program (GAP) is an intense, nine-month program designed to accelerate the growth of high potential small businesses located in Minneapolis. Targeted primarily, but not exclusively, to minority- and women-owned businesses, the program helps business owners address specific growth challenges. Through a competitive application process, 10-12 business owners are selected each year and given access to a comprehensive support system that includes one-on-one advising, MBA student consulting, and education and peer-group support. The program runs annually from September to May.
