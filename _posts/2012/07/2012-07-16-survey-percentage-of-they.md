Last year, the firm found that 27 percent of U.S. adults over the age of 18 indicated that they will opt out of online behavioral advertising to manage privacy. This year, that figure has nearly doubled to 50 percent. Additionally, 76 percent said they dont allow companies to share their personal information with a third party (up from 67 percent last year) and 90 percent said they use browser controls to protect their privacy, including deleting cookies (which is up from 84 percent last year). Fifty-eight percent of respondents said they do not like online behavioral advertising, which is an increase from 54 percent in 2011.
