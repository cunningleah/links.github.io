One of the questions we always get asked at meet-ups and conversations with other engineers is, whats your stack? We thought it would be fun to give a sense of all the systems that power Instagram, at a high-level; you can look forward to more in-depth descriptions of some of these systems in the future. This is how our system has evolved in the just-over-1-year that weve been live, and while there are parts were always re-working, this is a glimpse of how a startup with a small engineering team can scale to our 14 million+ users in a little over a year.
