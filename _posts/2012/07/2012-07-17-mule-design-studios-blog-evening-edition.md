To help answer that, we built Evening Edition. Its a summary of the days news, written by an actual journalist, with links to the best reporting in the world, published once a day. Its optimized for your phone or iPad so you can read it on the train home or on the couch. It can be the starting point for a deep-dive or just enough so you sound erudite at your next cocktail party. What its not, and what it will never be, is another chirp of noise constantly guilting you into checking it. Its breaking news for the slow web.
