Ira is a friend of mine. Nice to see him in this article and taking a strong position. The rest of the article is infuriating and highlights how far society has to go on gay rights. Two quotes from mothers terming this discriminatory practice as "protecting" their kids saddens me.

<blockquote>
Ira Mitchell has previously kept his sons, from left, Asher, 8, Field, 12, and Owen, 9, from joining the Boy Scouts because my kids are not going to be in an organization that discriminates against gay people. The Northern Star Councils stand has him reconsidering his position, though.
