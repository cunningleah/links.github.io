This camper seems more tent than camper, but it looks really cool. A frame that provides strength and then the tent part comes around it. Similar in some ways to a tent camper. No fancy fixtures, embedded cooler is the main amenity but the price is good, it's lightweight and you can haul stuff with it as well.

<blockquote>
This is the most unique camping and travel trailer you'll ever find. At only $7,995, GO was designed from the frame out to be a one-of-a-kind mobile adventure trailer that's even more versatile than a Swiss Army knife. It's lightweight and easy to manage in the parking lot, garage or on the road. Weighing in at 840 lbs, GO can be pulled by even the smallest cars. Best of all, GO is imagined, designed, engineered, created and assembled right here in America. GO is extremely well made and crafted to last.
