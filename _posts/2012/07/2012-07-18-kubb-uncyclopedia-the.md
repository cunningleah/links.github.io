This 'Kubb' entry was rescued from Wikipedia on 25th September 2006, in its most extreme and most untrue state. The article was subject to a sustained assault over a five-month period by contributors who were reacting against the censorious approach of one Wikipedia official. Gradually they changed the text, added fictitious names and events, and generally abused the concept of Kubb, whatever that may be. Kubb is a game of uncertain origins and with no official organisation to codify its rules. This uncertainty and ignorance makes it an ideal subject to be economical with the truth thereof. Nearly all the text is rubbish, but no-one now knows which parts are true.
