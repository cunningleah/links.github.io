I won a private coffee roasting class with Joe at the Matt Call Benefit. I can't wait to set this class up!

> The love of coffee and a drive for excellence, friendships and social justice have sent Joe on a pretty amazing journey. His first real experience with specialty coffee was in Nuova Segovia, Nicaragua in 2001. On his first night in Nicaragua, he celebrated his 21st birthday in small restaurant in Managua, not knowing that it would launch his adult life into this coffee filled quest.
