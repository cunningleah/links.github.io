This sounds like a really exciting restaurant opening up in our part of town. Plus sure to have an exceptional coffee program. Looking forward to trying this.

<blockquote>
What does a white tablecloth, superstar-trained chef do in South Minneapolis? A lot. Ireland tells me his restaurant will basically be a French-influenced American spot, in the same way that Lucias or Meritage are French-influenced American, which is to say more real-life-modern-American than French, but a little French under there too. In terms of real-life-modern-American: Theyll have third-wave coffee! The Lynn will operate as a coffee, light breakfast, and pastry spot first thing in the morning. But not just any coffee, light breakfast, and pastry spotthe coffee program is being designed by Andrew Kopplin, of St. Paul legend Kopplins Coffee.
