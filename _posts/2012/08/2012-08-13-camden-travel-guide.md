Camden is a affluent town in the state of Maine. It is located a little over an hour north of Portland, in the mid-coast region of Maine. It has been a tourist destination for years and is home to some of the wealthiest individuals in Maine. It had an economic boom in the 1990's when credit card giant MBNA placed major offices there and paid for major town renovations while providing jobs to locals. Now it is a upscale seaside community with many different shops and restaurants.
