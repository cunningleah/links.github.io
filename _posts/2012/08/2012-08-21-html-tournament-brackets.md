Need to look at this code to possibly get a nicer bracket on Planet Kubb Wiki.  <blockquote> Theres a lack of HTML code for tournament brackets out there that dont use tables, so I decided to go ahead and create some. I have tested this across all major browsers. To get an idea of how it works, start with the 4 player tournament, as it does get a little messy when you reach 32 players. </blockquote>
