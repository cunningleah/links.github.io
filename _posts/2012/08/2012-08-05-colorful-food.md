Mindy was an awesome designer at BigCharts back in the day and she just published a book! How awesome is that!

<blockquote>
"Colorful Food" is a beautiful introduction to the colorful world of fruits and vegetables for the emergent reader. The book provides an opportunity to learn about color, adjectives, and healthy foods. Ten different fruits and vegetables are presented according to their color. Juicy, red strawberries, squishy, blue blueberries, and crunchy, orange carrots, are just some of the foods children will enjoy reading about. The clear text, high-quality photography and excellent design make this book appealing to the youngest child as well as the adult reading along with them. A wonderfully photographed concept book that engages adults as well as children, this book is bound to be a classic.
