Whole article is worth it just for that paragraph. And to be clear, I like cold brewed coffee just as much as other preparations.

<blockquote>
Most people add milk and sugar because theyve only ever had bad coffee as a result of extremely stale beans, not enough grounds to water, and awful coffee makers. Bad coffee needs milk and sugar to be palatable to nearly anyone. And most people have no idea what theyre missing. Listening to someone rave about the great coffee from their offices new pod-canister machine or the great new brew at Starbucks is like hearing a repressed, middle-aged woman say Ive had orgasms before I think.
