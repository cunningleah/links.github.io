Schooner tour we booked for our trip in Camden. Recommended by Paul.

<blockquote>
Let us show you Penobscot Bay, with its rocky shoreline, lighthouses, seals, bald eagles, islands, lobster boats and hidden mansions. Schooner Olad sails daily from Camden, Maine; Memorial Day weekend to mid-October. Schooner Olad offers historic two-hour daysails aboard a completely restored, classic yacht. Schooner Olad also offers custom Sailing charters. Whether it is for two hours, a half day, or a full day, Olad is the perfect place for an office outing, family get-together, wedding or a wedding party. Catering is available.
