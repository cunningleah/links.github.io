Marco has the right approach here.

<blockquote>
If you want to make a 32-ounce coffee of any sort that doesnt suck, and doesnt make you explode from overcaffeination when you drink it, I cant help you. Its simply too much liquid, especially as the correspondingly huge amount of ice melts and dilutes it over the half hour it should take you to drink that much.
