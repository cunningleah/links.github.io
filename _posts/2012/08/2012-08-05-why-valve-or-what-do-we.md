You have read Valves survival manual for new employees. You have read Michael Abrashs wonderful account of working at Valve. Now read my political economy analysis of Valves management model; one in which there are no bosses, no delegation, no commands, no attempt by anyone to tell someone what to do. Can useful lessons be drawn about not only Valves inner workings but, importantly, regarding the future of the corporate world?
