I've wanted to put an accelerometer in my batons since the moment I picked up a Kubb set.

<blockquote>
While the answers in Agrimsons research could be the key to winning a Kubb championship, he has many more research questions that he will not have time to address before the national conference. Still, Agrimson plans to attach an accelerometer to his pinnars and calculate the acceleration needed to knock over a kubb, and he even hopes to delve more deeply into the history of the game.
