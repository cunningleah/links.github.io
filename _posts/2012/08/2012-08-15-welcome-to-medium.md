New "blogging" (maybe?) platform from Ev of Twitter fame. I don't really get what is so new here. The collections to me seem like topic pages, or even keywords. There must be something much much cooler here than I'm seeing, or not. I can't know yet though since you can only use it if your one of the cool digital people in the Valley that have coffee with Ev on a semi-regular basis (lame...).
