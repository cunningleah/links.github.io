We had a fabulous lunch at Chase's Daily on our Maine vacation. Everything about the place was great, in every way. Plus, as an added bonus, the first cold press coffee I found in Maine.

<blockquote>
When you have a garden, it's so easy to get spoiled by all the top quality produce that you grow. Dining out can often be disappointing because its clear many restaurants don't feel the way about fresh vegetables as you do. Chase's Daily is the exception, and the place in Belfast, Maine to head for local food on the menu. The Chase family owns and operates a 500-acre farm in nearby Freedom, and grows a large portion of the produce they serve in this breakfast and lunch spot. Dinners are only served on Fridays, and are top notch, as is the in-house bakery.
