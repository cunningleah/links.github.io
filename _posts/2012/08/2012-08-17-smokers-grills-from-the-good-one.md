The smoker that Mike got that isn't a Big Green Egg.

<blockquote>
The Good-One  Smoker/Grill was founded in 1988.  This endeavor evolved from the dreams and creative thinking of passionate, persistent, and prepared father and son entrepreneurs in Burns, Kansas.  Both Ron and Larry Goodwin have been involved in developing, manufacturing, distributing, marketing, selling, and servicing products for the outdoor cookers for over 20 years now.  Over the years, they conceived new brilliant ideas to make their product simpler, easier to use, and resulting in a superior product.  In March of 2007, Ace of Hearts BBQ Specialties purchased The Good-One  product line and partnered with Goodwin Industries, the manufacturer of The Good-One  to expand the brand nationally.
