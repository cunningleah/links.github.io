Heartfelt article forwarded to me by my fiend Mike who is a Dr. himself and knows the author of this article.

<blockquote>
We sit together in a room in a modern emergency department in a rich country, a land where highly trained specialists confidently wield the newest technologies and expensive pharmaceuticals. But these treasures are not accessible to all, for ours is also a land where private health insurance is bought and sold as a commodity. Ours is a system known to shake down sick people for money they dont have. Ours is the only wealthy democracy that fails to guarantee health coverage to all of its citizens.
