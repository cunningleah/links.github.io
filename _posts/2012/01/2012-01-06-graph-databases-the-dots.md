Big Data problems are quickly presenting themselves in almost every area of computing from Social Network Analysis to File Processing. Many technologies, such as those in the NoSQL space were developed in response to the limitations of current storage systems as an effective mechanism to deal with these mountains of data. And much of that data is interconnected in ways that, when organized properly, gives interesting and often valuable information. InfiniteGraph, the distributed and scalable graph database, was designed specifically to traverse connections and provide the framework for a new set of products built to provide real-time business decision support and relationship analytics. This presentation examines the technology behind InfiniteGraph and explores a couple of common use cases involving very large scale graph processing.
