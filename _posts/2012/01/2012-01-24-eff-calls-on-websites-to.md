January 28th is Data Privacy Day, also known as International Privacy Day. To celebrate, EFF is calling on users to protect online privacy by in three ways: download HTTPS Everywhere to ensure you use HTTPS when possible; help us catalog sites that are using HTTPS by contributing to HTTPS Now; and, if you administer a site, commit to enabling HTTPS support in 2012.
