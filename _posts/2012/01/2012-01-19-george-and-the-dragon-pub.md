Really good neighborhood restaurant.

<blockquote>
Located at 50th and Bryant in South Minneapolis, George and the Dragon is now serving pub classics and family recipes to Lynnhurst and its surrounding neighborhood. G&D strives to be a public house for the communities of South Minneapolis. A public house has traditionally been a gathering place for the community. Whether it be for a local sporting event, night out with friends and family or just because there is not enough time in the day to enjoy a scratch cooked meal, G&D provides that escape in a comfortable and casual environment. Featuring locally sourced food, beer and art.
