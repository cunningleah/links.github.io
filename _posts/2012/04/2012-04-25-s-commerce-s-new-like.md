This means that Nine West, American Apparel and Elle magazine will implement buttons on Graphite such as want, own or love; e-tailer Nasty Gals social action buttons will read Neeed, with three es, Gimme and &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 upon its Graphite launch in the next week, and Hallmark Cards will have brand-appropriate buttons that say Tearing Up, Love, Smile and LOL.
