With Mindful Browsing, you can block the websites that cause you these problems. Once blocked, if you try to visit one of these sites by following a link, clicking a bookmark, or typing the address, Mindful Browsing will show you a warning page reminding you that you blocked the site, and encouraging you to decide whether or not you really want to visit the site.
