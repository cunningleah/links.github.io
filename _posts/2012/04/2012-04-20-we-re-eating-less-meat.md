I think we forget that companies make a lot of money getting us to shove food into our mouth, and a big percentage of those companies are schilling animal products. The theoretical "War on Meat" reference from industry is ridiculous, but so typical of American companies. It's not enough to get the government out of their way, they want the government pushing the product.

<blockquote>
But thats changing, and considering the fairly steady climb in meat consumption over the last half-century, you might say the numbers are plummeting. The department of agriculture projects that our meat and poultry consumption will fall again this year, to about 12.2 percent less in 2012 than it was in 2007. Beef consumption has been in decline for about 20 years; the drop in chicken is even more dramatic, over the last five years or so; pork also has been steadily slipping for about five years.
