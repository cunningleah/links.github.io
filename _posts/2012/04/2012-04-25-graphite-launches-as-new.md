Users shopping on the website of a brand that uses Graphite can, for example, click that they love, want, or own certain items if theyre shopping on Elle.com or that they neeed (extra e intentional) and cant wait to wear something if theyre shopping on Nasty Gal. Those shared comments will appear on Facebook for their friends to see.
