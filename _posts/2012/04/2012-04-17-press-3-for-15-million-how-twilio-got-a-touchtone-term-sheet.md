The Bessemer app allowed Lawson to dial a Twilio-connected number, which then played a touch-tone phone menu. According to Lawson, Deeter sent him a text message saying, We want to talk about the term sheet, please call this number. When he called in, the automated voice said, Press one for $5 million, press two for $10 million, press three for $15 million.
