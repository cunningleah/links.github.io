Low productivity caused me to try to compensate by working longer hours, routinely 10-12 hours a day, with the occasional saturday thrown in. This of course lowered productivity even more. With impossible deadlines, I tried to push through, thinking I could handle it just a little bit longer. I had a vacation planned in february, so I kept thinking I would finish the projects before then, and get some well deserved rest later.
