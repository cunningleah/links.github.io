Important to keep in mind. I was happily running iptables on my hosts but didn't consider running ip6tables and I'm advertising IPv6 addresses.

In a draft proposal filed Tuesday with the Internet Engineering Task Force, a security consultant warned that IPv6 traffic is often able to bypass firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and other security protections. With the majority of end-user devices now speaking the new language by default, their use may have serious unintended consequences.
