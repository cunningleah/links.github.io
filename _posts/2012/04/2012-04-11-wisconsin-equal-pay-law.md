After all, men need money more than women do, since they have families to support. You could argue that money is more important for men, he told Goldberg. I think a guy in their first job, maybe because they expect to be a breadwinner someday, may be a little more money-conscious. To attribute everything to a so-called bias in the workplace is just not true.
