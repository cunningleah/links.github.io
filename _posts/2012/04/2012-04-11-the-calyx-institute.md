Imagine a telecommunications company that prioritizes privacy over profits. The Calyx Institute is poised to turn this prospect into reality by launching the first not-just-for-profit telephone and Internet service as part of its research into privacy technology. Calyx's charter directs it to use all legal and technical resources available to protect the rights of its constituents and customers.
