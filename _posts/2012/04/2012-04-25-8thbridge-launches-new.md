The new tool, called Graphite, lets customers use new verbs such as want, need, or have to describe their relationships to various brands. For example, if a customer viewing a dress on American Apparel selects the want button next to the item, it will post on that customers Facebook page that she wanted that dress, which could cause friends to buy it for her.
