Social commerce could be on the verge of expansion with a new service called Graphite, which allows brands to better leverage their social media. For a fee, retailers can install a whole range of buttons on their web sites, spin-offs of the traditional Facebook like and Twitter tweet this choices. When visitors click one of the bespoke buttons attached to a particular product, their choice and the item will show up on their Facebook timeline.
