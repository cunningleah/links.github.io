Good overview from Marco Arment on various lightbulbs. I have the EarthLED ones in our house, inside a number of "can light" fixtures and we like them fine. I put them in spots that have the highest lightbulb usage for maximum cost and energy savings.

> I wanted to try LED bulbs, but my Amazon research only found divided opinions and a lot of uncertainty. With no clear “winner”, I decided to buy four of the top-rated choices fitting my criteria, figuring I’d buy more of whichever I liked best and find tucked-away homes (closets, the utility room, the basement) for the crappy ones.
