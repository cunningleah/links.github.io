Like Facebooks social plugins, the Graphite social plugins allow brands to create custom Open Graph-powered social buttons that require little, if any, IT involvement to deploy. Until today, this integration required too much internal technical support to accomplish it. Graphite solves this problem by making multi-channel social commerce as easy to implement as the Facebook Like button, said Jon Kubo, Chief Product Officer at 8thBridge. Just as installing a Facebook Like button simply requires pasting a few lines of code into a product page, the same is true for Graphite custom buttons.
