The Minnesota Open Data website includes searchable keywords that provide access to "raw" datasets and various links. In the "raw" data, you will be able to access data in XML, Text/CSV, KML/KMZ, Feeds, XLS, or ESRI Shapefile formats. In some cases, your search may take you to a link that may have multiple datasets.
