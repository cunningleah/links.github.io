Im often asked why I chose OmniFocus, how I have it configured and what my day-to-day use of OmniFocus looks like. This article is all about how and why I use OmniFocus and the best practices Ive implemented based on my in-depth study of David Allens GTD methodology. It also draws on wisdom Ive gained through working with people as an OmniFocus Consultant and Trainerand is inspired by the many OmniFocus articles and training videos that Ive consumed over the years.
