Oh, this is too funny -- a British television skit on understanding financial markets. I've never felt that embedding funny YouTube videos was something I needed to do in this venue, but this one made me change my mind.


Unless your securities portfolio consists entirely of Apple stock, you have to be wondering what the hell is going on in the market today, and seriously questioning whether you have the cajones to stay in it. Well, watch this -- talk about comic relief! Man, does everyone need a little of this right now. (Tip of the hat to Paul Kedrosky of Infectious Greed for the heads-up to this one.)
