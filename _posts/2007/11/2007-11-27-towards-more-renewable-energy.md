Posted by Larry Page, Co-Founder and President of ProductsClean and affordable energy is a growing need for our company, and were excited about the opportunity to help create competitive green alternatives. Our new  initiative isnt just about Googles energy needs; we're seeking to  accelerate the pace at which clean energy technologies are developing, so they can rival the economics of coal quickly. We've gained expertise in designing and building large-scale, energy-intensive facilities by building data centers that lead the industry in efficiency. We want to apply the same creativity and innovation to the challenge of generating inexpensive renewable electricity at  scale.Promising technologies already exist that could be developed to deliver renewable energy cheaper than coal. We think the time is ripe to build rapidly on the tremendous work on renewable energy. For example, I believe that solar thermal technology provides a very plausible path to generating cheaper electricity. By combining talented technologists, great partners and large investments, we have an opportunity to quickly push this technology forward. Our goal is to build 1 gigawatt of  renewable energy capacity that is cheaper than coal. We are optimistic that this  can be done within years, not decades. If we succeed, it would likely provide a  path to replacing a substantial portion of the worlds electricity needs with renewable energy sources.To lead this effort, we're looking for a world-class team. We need creative and motivated entrepreneurs and technologists with expertise in a broad range of  areas, including materials science, physics, chemistry, mechanical  engineering, electrical engineering, land acquisition and management, power  transmission and substations, construction, and regulatory issues. Join us. And if you're interested, read about our previous work toward a  clean energy future.
