Tons of people I respect have been telling me to get on Dopplr for a long time. Well, yesterday at the LeWeb3 conference they finally opened the service up to the public, so I got on. I also got a demo and an interview with the CEO and CTO and I can definitely see that this will be a favorite service of mine. Jimmy Wales, Wikipedia founder, says that Dopplr is his favorite non-Wiki Web site, according to the Dopplr blog, which also has tons of other details on the service. More next week when I get my interviews up and have some time to play more with the service.

UPDATE: Web Worker Daily has a good article on other things for travelers.
