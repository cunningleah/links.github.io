At a time when the most fortunate of us are preparing for holiday vacations, a new documentary reveals Guatemala as a hot spot of another sort â€” for serial killers of women and girls.


"Killer's Paradise," which screens Thursday night at the Riverview Branch of the St. Paul Public Library, takes no more than 90 seconds to get under one's skin. The film begins at a Guatemala City crime scene with the discovery of a murdered 21-year-old woman, shot in cold blood while walking on the street with her young kids. "Why is Mommy sleeping in the road?" one of the children asks.
