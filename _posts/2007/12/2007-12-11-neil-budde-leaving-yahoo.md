Last week, when I checked with Neil Budde and inside Yahoo after Valleywag floated the idea that he was leaving, I was told that wasnt the case. But the situation changed following internal discussions about the Yahoo News vets position on Scott Moores new org chart  turns out there really wasnt one for his most recent role of editor-in-chief across news, sports and finance  and Budde, who contributed considerably to the improvements of the past few years, is on his way out.
