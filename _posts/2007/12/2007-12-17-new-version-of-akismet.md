There is a new version of Akismet out today, and this time it looks like they are taking some cues from their competitors and users in adding new features:

Version 2.1 main new addition is the ability to filter by comment type, as seen here:

Theres also a new hook so other plugins could add addition tabs to the sub-nav as well  Im curious to see what people end up putting there. If you use that hook for a plugin, be sure to let me know so we can blog about it.

Check out the full post, as well as the download link on the Akismet blog.
