When it comes to working with Google data on mobile devices, Google isnt all about the iPhone after all. A few weeks after Google  updated their cross-platform Maps application comes some new love for those of us with Blackberry devices.

Sync connects the native Blackberry calendar to Google Calendar.  Once installed, you simply tell it which Google calendars to sync and the rest takes care of itself automatically. In quick tests on a Blackberry 8800 it works very well. Faster and more functional than visiting your calendar page in a mobile browser. Perhaps support for Nokia and Windows Mobile devices wont be far behind?

Read more on the new Official Google Mobile blog.

In other Google/Blackberry news, theyve also introduced an updater application to keep track of the latest versions of all these applications on your device.
