We hear from a well-placed but second-hand source that "Daily Show" host Jon Stewart plans to go back on the air Jan. 7. Comedy Central says no decision has been made on whether Stewart and Stephen Colbert will return, and a writer on one of the shows told us they are unaware of any plans. But we hear that all "Daily Show" and "Colbert Report" employees -- except for writers -- been told to show up for work Jan. 7, whether a strike is resolved or not, and we find this plausible.
