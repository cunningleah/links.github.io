In an Associated Press piece about Jeff Tweedy, the lead singer of Wilco and a well-known former drug addict, theres a hilarious anecdote about how his 11-year-old son learned of his past drug use:  Well, you know Spencer is 11, and awhile back, he said I just read on Wikipedia that you started smoking pot when you quit drinking in nineteen-whatever. That makes me so mad. Wikipedia is always so wrong. Its just like, so stupid.   And I had to take him aside and say Spencer, I didnt think I was going to have to have this discussion with you at this age, because it is not something that has really entered your world, but I dont want to lie to you.   That Wikipedia thing, there are probably a lot of wrong things on there, but that is not one of them. That happened.  I think that anecdote says a lot about Wikipedia and the nature of modern fame, and also about the difficulties of parenting in a social-media world  plus its hilarious to boot. And the rest of the interview is well worth a read too, if you like Wilco at all (which I do).   (via The Listenerd)  Share This
