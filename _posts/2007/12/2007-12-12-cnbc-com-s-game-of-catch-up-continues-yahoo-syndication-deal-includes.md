CNBC.com will syndicate news stories and video on Yahoo (NSDQ: YHOO) Finance, reflecting the cable news channel's push to broaden the online reach for its content. In addition to its U.S. coverage, the deal is CNBC's first global agreement and includes content produced by its CNBC Asia and CNBC Europe units. Yahoo Finance will have access to segments from the cable channel's programming, such as Mad Money with Jim Cramer and Fast Money.



The alliance comes amid increased competition among financial news sites and slowing ad growth. For CNBC, the agreement follows the ad sales pact it made this week with Microsoft (NSDQ: MSFT) and MSN Money. Just as MSN Money bets that an association with CNBC will increase its brand awareness and ad revenue, CNBC expects the same will happen to it by linking up with Yahoo Finance. Release



-- NYT: "Although CNBC is the dominant business brand on television, its website has struggled to gain market share. The site's traffic has tripled since a highly publicized reintroduction a year ago, but it still averaged only 538,000 unique visitors in November, according to the company comScore, (NSDQ: SCOR) which measures Internet use." 



Disclaimer: ContentNext Media, our parent company, has a syndication relationship with Yahoo Finance.
