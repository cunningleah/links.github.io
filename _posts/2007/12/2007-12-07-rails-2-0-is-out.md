Yes, yes, I've been awfully quiet here lately. But let's blame that on the long crunch session for Rails 2.0 and call it cheers, ye? It's out, gawd dammit. Finally. After about a year in development and oh-so-many we're-almost-there's. Feels good, does it.


Now I just have to put the final hand on the new screencast for Rails. The current one is awfully stale.


So dig in and get it: Rails 2.0.
