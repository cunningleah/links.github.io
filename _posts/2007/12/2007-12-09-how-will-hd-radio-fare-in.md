Radiosophy, a three-year-old company that makes affordable HD radios, emailed me their newsletter and it was full of some interesting bits. For instance, there are 1,000 HD sub-channels broadcasting in U.S. markets. Next year, look for an emphasis on the HD sub-channel programming, including sports and special interest content. Will that be enough to lift the fortunes of HD radio in 2008? And if you are interested in HD radio, check out these web sites: Radio-Locator, which is like TV Guide for HD Radio, and V-Soft, which helps find signal strength in your zip code.
