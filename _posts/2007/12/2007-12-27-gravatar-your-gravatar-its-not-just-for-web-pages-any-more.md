Simon Menke wrote a Mac OSX 10.5 plugin for the address book which brings gravatars off the web site and into your contacts.  Simon intuitively grasped something that we were planning on highlighting after doing some more work with the gravatar site and processes: gravatars are something that can be used almost anywhere.  Sure the most common place you’ll see them now is on blog comments, but the sky truly is the limit.  Way to go Simon!
