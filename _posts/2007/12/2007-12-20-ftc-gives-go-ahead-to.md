This just in: Googles $3.1 billion merger with DoubleClick has been cleared by the Federal Trade Commission, which said it saw neither current nor potential competitive problems with the deal. Australia and Brazil have already cleared it as well, but Google cannot close the acquisition until the European Commission, which is still examining it, gives the OK.
