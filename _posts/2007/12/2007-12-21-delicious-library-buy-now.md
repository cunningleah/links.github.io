As you might have guessed after we shipped Delicious Library, we've been working on Delicious Library 2. Shocking, I know.We've had some nice previews on Theocacoa, Ars Technica, The Unofficial Apple Weblog, and, of course, Apple.We're working our butts off on version 2 ever since we shipped version 1, but there have been delays - first off, because we had two very major free updates to version 1
