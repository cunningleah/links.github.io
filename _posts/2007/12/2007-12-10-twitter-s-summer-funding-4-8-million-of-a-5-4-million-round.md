Twitter's funding round from this summer, which we reported on sans amount, netted the company $4.8 million, according to a regulatory filing obtained by PE Hub. The round, which came from Union Square Ventures, Charles River Ventures and several individuals, could be as big as $5.4 million. There had been unconfirmed rumors that the raise was in this ballpark. The company is currently not raising more money but may do so next year.
