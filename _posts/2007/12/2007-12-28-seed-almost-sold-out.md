Along with Jim Coudal of Coudal Partners and Carlos Segura of Segura Inc. and T.26, we’re again presenting a one-day conference on design, entrepreneurship and inspiration on Chicago’s IIT Campus. The date is Friday, January 18th.



We’ve sold over 120 seats so far so there are just a couple dozen left. For more on what it’s all about, check Mike Rohde’s illustrated notes from the first Seed and a couple reviews too. And this guy is going to SEED instead of MacWorld.
