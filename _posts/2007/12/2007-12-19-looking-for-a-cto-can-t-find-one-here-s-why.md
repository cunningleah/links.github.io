One of the reasons people work at startups to begin with is because they feel like their work will be a lot more rewarding versus working in a big company.  If their work isn't highly valued by the people that start the business, then what's the point of even working for a startup?  No one's going to join a business team as the CTO for a 5% stake in the company or if your first thought is, "I don't want to give that much away."
