Famous blogger Robert Scoble will be leaving his current job at PodTech in mid January, he says. He will likely be joining Fast Company to start Fast Company TV.

Scoble was with PodTech for just a year and a half. He was previously at Microsoft and acted as their unofficial spokesperson.

Scoble isnt saying if hell continue to use the same format as his current show, ScobleShow, where he interviews entrepreneurs daily. Another big question is whether his sponsor, Seagate, will follow him to Fast Company. Its rumored Seagate is paying a massive fee to sponsor the show.

This is another blow for PodTech, which has already lost its founding CEO and is nearly out of money. The company has run through $7.5 million in funding. They are rumored to be closing on another million or so in bridge financing. But theyre very, very close to the deadpool.
