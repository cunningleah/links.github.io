In the Leopard onslaught, Cha-Ching 1.2 slipped under our radar - however today sees the release of yet another (minor) update: version 1.2.1. For those of you not familiar with Cha-Ching, it's an easy-to-use money-management tool whose import options (such as Quicken and Microsoft Money formats) and slick interface mean that you might not need something such as Quicken to balance your books.Of course, you're all clamouring for the details of what's new and exciting in this update. There's plenty of enhancements, not least of which are a number of Leopard fixes to ensure that Leopard-running folks can start budgeting (for MacWorld San Francisco?) in style with: 

    the ability to backup vaults locally (in addition to the existing .Mac backup option)
    the ability to pay bills directly from the Master Vault
    plenty of graphical enhancements for the new big-cat

Cha-Ching sells for $40, with version 1.2.1 a free update for existing registered users. Version 1.2.1 is available now from the Midnight Apps website or via the built-in software update.Read
