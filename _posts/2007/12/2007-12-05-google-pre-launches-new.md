We heard a rumor that Google was going to launch a new interface for users accessing the site via an iPhone in the next few days. But an anonymous tip let us know it actually launched without any warning or announcement this evening.   If you visit Google.com from an iPhone, you now get a menu of services to choose from - home (search box), Gmail, Calendar, Reader and More (docs, sms, goog-411, news, photos, blogger and notebook). Its basically all of the core Google services, accessible from a single easy to use menu.  The new application has what is now considered a signature look for the iPhone. The look and feel of many of the interface elements are similar to those created by Joe Hewitt, whose sample framework and code have been used in dozens of iPhone applications (see his Facebook product here). I dont know if Google used any of his freely offered code, but it certainly has the look of one of his applications.   Accessing the site through other mobile devices continues to deliver the old Google Mobile interface.  More pictures of the interface are below, created with a simulator. Real but poor quality images are here.       Crunch Network:  MobileCrunch Mobile Gadgets and Applications, Delivered Daily.
