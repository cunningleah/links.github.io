In the months leading up to Rupert Murdoch's WSJ takeover, some of the Dow Jones crew insisted that WSJ.com might keep its subscription wall -- even though Murdoch clearly intended to tear it down. Now that reality has set in, it will be fascinating to watch WSJ.com turn all of its focus on advertising metrics like uniques and page views.Baby steps first... 
        Today's WSJ.com features a clumsy "slide show"
presenting some of the big names named in the baseball's Mitchell
report. Online publishers love slide shows, because they turn a single
story into multiple page views. But in most cases, they don't do users
much good, because they make it difficult to navigate back and forth
between bits of information, instead of presenting it to them in one
shot.The WSJ slideshow isn't terrible in this regard -- it lets you know,
along the bottom of each slide, that there are 8 other slides, and lets
you click directly to them. But compare and contrast with the NYT.com's
awesome presentation,
which delivers thumbnail images of all 81 players named in the steroid
report, on a single page, and makes it easy to jump back and forth
between the main page and individual bios. If you've got any interest
in baseball at all, you're going to spend some time here.

Make no mistake: The difference between the two papers' presentations has nothing to do with ideology and ownership -- just experience. The
NYT has been trying to build its online audience for many years, and
reports like today's are the result of a lot of time and money spent on
those efforts. The WSJ, which hasn't paid nearly as much attention to
this stuff, has a lot of catching up to do. And Rupe will make sure they
move as fast as possible.
