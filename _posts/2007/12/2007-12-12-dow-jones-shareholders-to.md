Not that it was in doubt by this point, but Dow Jones (NYSE: DJ) shareholders will accept News Corp.'s (NYSE: NWS) $60 per share offer for the company. The actual shareholder meeting is scheduled for tomorrow, but a count of proxy ballots confirms the deal will have enough support, reports WSJ, citing people familiar with the matter. The final tally, including the ultimate level of support from the Bancroft family, is still not known.
