Legend has it that Chinese workers brought this method of cooking with them when they came to Cuba to work on the railroads in the 1850's, thus the name 'Caja China' which means Chinese Box. Others claim that similar boxes are used throughout the Caribbean for roasting but no one knows for sure why they are called Chinese. The origin of the name may remain a mystery. But the facts are undeniably mouth-watering. The Guerra family brought the secret of making these extra-ordinary roasting boxes from Cuba to Miami. And the results are uniformly spectacular. A perfect outcome, every time, guaranteed!
