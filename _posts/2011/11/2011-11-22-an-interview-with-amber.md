There’s a box in the closet running a custom IRC server with an IRC bot named Loqi. Loqi can set timers, remember information, store things on an internal WordPress site called “The Brain”, leave messages for other users when they are away, start the music, turn on and off the lights, set the lights on timers and countdowns, and tell jokes.
