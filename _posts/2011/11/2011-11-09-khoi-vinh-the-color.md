We sat down with Khoi Vinh, former Design Director of NYTimes.com and founder of Mixel, to discuss the subject that has made his work most noteworthy: the grid. And in his case, the g almost deserves to be capitalized. The result is an illuminating conversation about Khois plans for the future, first interest in the field of design, and even the grids complex relationship with emotion.
