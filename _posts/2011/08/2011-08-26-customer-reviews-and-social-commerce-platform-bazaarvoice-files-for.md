Bazaarvoice has filed its S-1 with the SEC today. The company aims to raise as much as $86.25 million in its offering.

Unfortunately, the company is not yet profitable, and has been posting net losses for the past few years. In 2009, 2010 and 2011, the company posted net losses of $5 million, $8 million and $20 million, respectively. And the company warns that it has accumulated a deficit of $40.8 million and may continue to incur losses for the ‘foreseeable future.’
