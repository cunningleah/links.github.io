This may come as a shock considering how seriously Facebook takes your privacy, but if youre a Facebook user with one of Facebooks mobile applications installed on your iPhone or one of several other smartphones, youve been robbed. Each and every contact stored on your phone is probably now also stored on Facebooks servers, as was re-re-rediscovered by Facebook users this past week. Whether or not people in your contact list even have Facebook accounts, their names and phone numbers are likely now in Facebooks possession. There is probably a clause buried deep within Facebooks terms and conditions that makes this invasion of your privacy OK on paper, but odds are still pretty good that its not OK with you. Complete instructions outlining how to remove all of your contacts phone numbers from your Facebook account can be found below. Whether or not the data will be completely wiped from Facebooks servers is unclear, but well leave that for the lawyers to figure out.
