Much like a relational database, one stores information in a triplestore and retrieves it via a query language. Unlike a relational database, a triplestore is optimized for the storage and retrieval of many short statements called triples, in the form of subject-predicate-object, like "Bob is 35" or "Bob knows Fred".
