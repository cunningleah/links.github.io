"I am writing to encourage the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and the Department of Justice (DOJ) to reject the proposal of AT&T, Inc. (AT&T) and Deutsche Telekom AG to transfer control of the licenses held by T-Mobile USA, Inc. (T-Mobile) and its subsidiaries to AT&T. Allowing this merger to proceed would lead to an effective duopoly in the national wireless market that would result in higher prices for consumers and potentially thousands of job losses. My examination of this transaction has led me to conclude that AT&T's acquisition ofT-Mobile would substantially lessen competition in the already highly concentrated wireless communications market. In addition to my antitrust concerns, I am convinced that this type of horizontal consolidation does not serve the public interest. Consumers, businesses, regional wireless service providers, and handset manufacturers all depend on a competitive wireless market. The destruction of that competition would have grave repercussions for the economy as a whole and cannot be ameliorated by the application of conditions. I urge you to deny this proposal in its entirety. Below is a more detailed list of my specific concerns."
