These folks attached a cable to France's highest twin towers and then walked around on it. Really wild shots. These guys are wearing saftey harnesses, which tells me they're stupid or crazy, but not both, and definitely not at the same time. I love them for that.





I saw the title and the teaser shot this morning and knew immediately this is what I'd be posting on Kottke tonight. Incidentally, I was looking for more information on highliners or skyliners, but I couldn't find any... I thought everything was on Wikipedia?


Update:
Couldn't find it on Wikipedia because it's called Slacklining, not highlining. There was subtle misdirection in the video description. Also, peep the Daft Punk soundtrack. (Thanks, @Complex)
