I follow the Getting Things Done system. Yes, it's a cult (). The master says purge ToDo lists weekly. So today I will.  <blockquote> Humans have a problem with stuff. Allen defines stuff as anything we want or need to do. A tax form has the same status as a marriage proposal; a book to write is no different than a grocery list. It's all stuff. </blockquote>
