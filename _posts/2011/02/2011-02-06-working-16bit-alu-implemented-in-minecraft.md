Oh and mind you, this is not just a inanimate replica - this is an actual, working and calculating 16bit arithmetic logic unit that had to be debugged in-game. Its creator's next goal is to - I'm not kidding you - build memory to go with the ALU. This is completely and utterly mindbogglingly crazy and insanely awesome all at the same time.
