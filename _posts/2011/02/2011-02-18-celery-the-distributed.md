We use this library extensively for messaging in Python at 8thBridge.  <blockquote> Celery is an asynchronous task queue/job queue based on distributed message passing.It is focused on real-time operation, but supports scheduling as well. The execution units, called tasks, are executed concurrently on a single or more worker servers using multiprocessing, Eventlet, or gevent. Tasks can execute asynchronously (in the background) or synchronously (wait until ready). </blockquote>
