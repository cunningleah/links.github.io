Relying on these application files for our precious words is a mistake. Standards and preferences change. What your computer can understand today, it may not tomorrow.

Ive got a shelf full of backed-up work that is essentially useless because the applications, file formats, and technologies I used to create the work no longer exists. 

What value is an archive if its not usable years later?
