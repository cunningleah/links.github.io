The Hive begins with a single, challenging problem, a problem that is difficult and important but not so abstruse that ordinary, intelligent people can't understand it. It should be a problem that, if we managed to solve it even a little bit, could genuinely improve in the lives of people around the world. We're introducing the first of these problems today, in an article by Daniel Gross, "The Efficient Life." Gross is inviting readers to come up with compelling and useful ways for Americans to use less energy in their homes and save money. Your proposals could range from technological fixes (programmable thermostats, perhaps) to policy changes (new tax incentives for purchasing energy efficient appliances) to psychological insights about behavior (ways to use peer pressure to reduce energy use) to anything elsethe more unconventional and brilliant, the better. Surprise us!
