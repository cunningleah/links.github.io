Jetty includes a servlet implementation of the Bayeux protocol of the CometD project from the Dojo Foundation.

CometD is a message bus for Ajax web applications that allows multi channel messaging between client and server - and more importantly - between server and client. The paradigm is publish/subscribe to named channels.
