The LoFerno fire pit is the latest thing in patio fire pits.  Its patent-pending fire tower design provides more warmth from the same amount of wood and an exciting visual display of flame dancing through the decorative openings.  The fire tower section sits freely inside the fire bowl and can be easily removed with the handles at the top.  The patented fire tower section of the LoFerno fire pit is designed to hold wood upright, which makes for a cleaner burn and helps radiate more heat.  Since the critical mass of the fire is held above the rim of the fire bowl you and your friends can enjoy its full warmth and excitement.
