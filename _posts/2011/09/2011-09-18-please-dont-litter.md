We live right across from Minnehaha Creek and the creek is very low right now. There hasn’t been a good rain for a long time and the creek is just a trickle. We all were walking in the park yesterday and walked out in some dry area of the creek. We picked up four pieces of broken glass, an aluminum can, a foot-long section of car siding (huh?) and a discarded insect repellent bottle.

Mazie and I try to pick up any trash we find when we are by the creek. She made this sign and we are going to see if we can post it by the area we often find garbage.
