The papers chosen herein are not intended to act as a C.S. hall of fame, but instead hope to accomplish the following: All papers are freely available online (i.e. not pay-walled), They are technical (at times highly so), They cover a wide-range of topics and They form the basis of knowledge that every great programmer should know, and may already. Because of these constraints I will have missed some great papers, but for the most part I think this list is solid. Please feel free to disagree and offer alternatives in the comments.
