Post written by Leo Babauta.
“Follow your passion.”  It sounds so easy.  So why do so many people struggle to find the career they’re excited to wake up to every morning?

Today, I held a free webinar with Jennifer Gresham, founder of the No Regrets Career Academy, called, “5 Shortcuts to Finding Your Passion.”

Jen took a thoughtful look at how to “follow your passion” and find your “fire in the belly” with confidence, and shared:


How to tell if your passion is career material or just a hobby
Anti-passions (and why you can’t ignore them)
Why passion isn’t everything
The #1 mistake people make when choosing a passion
Advice for the extremely passionate (do you have to choose?)

Jen and I also answered a ton of questions about finding your passion.
