Yesterday Facebook announced the new profile, timeline, but the beta version doesnt wont come out until at least the end of this month, if not later, and you have to sign up for it in advance  but, theres a way to activate it right now, without the wait.


Facebook gives developers early access to timeline so they can develop applications for it. However, you dont really have to be a real developer, just pretend to be one! Heres how.

Step 1: Start Facebooks Developer Application

Facebook has a page, a group and an application called Developer  you want to click on the app, which you can find here.

If youve never used this app before, youll need to allow it to access your basic information, the same way you would when launching anything else for the first time on Facebook.



After youve installed the Developer tool, click on create a new app, a button that appears in the top right corner of the screen.

Step Two: Make Up A Name

Developer asks you to provide some information about this app you just clicked the create button for.

A pop-up asks you to input a display name and a namespace, and two of them cant be exactly the same. Its simplest to type in your full name for the first field and then in the second area, type it in without any spaces between words.



Then a security popup window pops up, asking you to type in the letters you see.

Step Three: Launch Open Graph



Within the left-hand column, click on the words open graph.

Fill out two different verbs. You can use get profile or choose whatever you want.

Now youre almost done.

After a few minutes, your profile will display a notification across the top suggesting you try timeline.

Click get itnow and start playing with your timeline.


Notice the upgrade is irreversible, so dont shoot the messenger if you dont like it.

Until the beta version of timeline becomes available to non-developers  Facebook says this will happen on September 30  only people whove upgraded their profiles to timelines will be able to see your timeline.

Readers, have you upgraded your profile to timeline yet? If so, did you do anything creative with your cover photo? Please share your experiences in the comments section.
