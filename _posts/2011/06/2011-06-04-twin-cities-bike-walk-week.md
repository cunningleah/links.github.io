The days are getting longer and the temperature is getting warmer. Do you know what that means? Summer is right around the corner and it’s time to Get Tuned Up with Bike Walk Week! This summer celebration runs from June 4-12 and will once again feature a Women’s Wednesday ride, Bike Walk to Work Day and the very first Minneapolis Open Streets celebration.
