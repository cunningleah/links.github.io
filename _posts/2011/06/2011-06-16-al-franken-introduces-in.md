Senator Al Franken (D-Minn.) is one of a group of politicians that have been making a lot of noise about digital privacy in the past several months. Hes the one who called Apple (NSDQ: AAPL) and Google (NSDQ: GOOG) to testify about the issue of location privacy last month. Now, Franken and Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) have introduced the first locational privacy bill, which would require smartphone companies like Apple and Google to tell consumers more about the kinds of information sharing they do.
