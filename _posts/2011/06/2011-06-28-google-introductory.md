I don’t want to place a bet that these things are going to take off — and the more I learn, the more it seems clear that “Google+” is an umbrella name for several individual services, rather than a single unified thing — but these introductory videos are really well done. Note that the UI screenshots are even set in Helvetica, not Arial. Some of the best evidence of good taste at Google I can ever recall.


Sidenote: Regarding mobile clients, Google writes:



  Starting today Google+ is available on Android Market and the
mobile web, and it’s coming soon to the App Store.



Not the “iOS App Store” or “iTunes App Store”. Just “App Store”.
