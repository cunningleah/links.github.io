In an attempt to make its Graph API more accessible Facebook today launched a new service called the Graph API Explorer. The Explorer helps you sign-up for an access token, experiment with Graph API commands and see the results and explore the results to help understand what the different responses mean.

The Graph Explorer will only return data you have access to - data that's public, or that has been shared with your user account.
