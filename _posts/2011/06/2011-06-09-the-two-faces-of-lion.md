The most frequent question Ive been asked since Apples Worldwide Developer Conference keynote on Monday is whether Mac OS X 10.7 Lion is boring. Thats a fair question. The last real overhaul of features that significantly affected the user experience of Mac OS X came with 10.5 Leopard, which tweaked the interface and improved a number of applications and system elements that we interact with all the time, such as the Finder. In contrast, Apple billed 10.6 Snow Leopard as containing largely under-the-hood changes meant to improve performance and provide a more coherent foundation for future development.
