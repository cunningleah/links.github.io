The DSLR Follow Focus eliminates the awkward perpendicular hand position required to turn a focus or zoom ring, giving the user much finer adjustment than could be achieved without such a device. The DSLR Follow Focus also works great for precise macro focusing and is equally at home on a zoom ring.
