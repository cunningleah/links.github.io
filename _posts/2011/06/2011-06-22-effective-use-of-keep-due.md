Why I keep due dates sacred in OmniFocus:

> Due dates are a great idea, especially the integration with calendars which gives you notifications when tasks are due. However I began to notice an interesting phenomenon: the more I planned and micromanaged my tasks, the more my notifications would increase. I would sit and list all the things I wanted to get done that day, and then set a due date of today on all of them. Then I would set the next action to be due tomorrow, and the next in two days, etc. What I found was that I perpetually had a little red badge on the app icon telling me how much I still hadnt done. I began to resent the badge. No matter how many tasks I completed, it would always come back again because there was always more to be done tomorrow. This began to really wear me down, and I just started to ignore OmniFocus. I didnt want to see that badge any more, because I never got the satisfaction of saying, Ive completed what I needed to today, now I can relax.
