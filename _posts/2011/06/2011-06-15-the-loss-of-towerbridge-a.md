It seems so short-sighted that a museum has deleted all of this - all of the URLs pointing at this account are now broken. A genuinely interesting part of the bridge's, and the internet's history is now gone, whereas the opposite should have happened - this account should have been included in the museum's activity. People enjoyed the account, it proved an interesting and funny way of humanising the day-to-day operations of the structure in a way that hadn't been done before.  <blockquote> Sad news - the unofficial @towerbridge account has been shut down and replaced with an official one. </blockquote>
