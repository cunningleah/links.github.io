Your 1Password master password is extremely important. Although we take steps to thwart automated password crackers you should still use a strong, memorable master password. Password cracking tools are becoming more powerful every year, and too much is at stake in your 1Password data. Given the strength of the encryption we use, your master password is likely to be the weakest link in your 1Password security. Dont be too scared of that. Given how strong everything else is, it would be practically impossible to use and remember a master password that is actually stronger than 1Passwords encryption.
