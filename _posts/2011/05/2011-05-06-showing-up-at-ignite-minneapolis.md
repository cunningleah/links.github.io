Imagine if you had a crystal ball and knew you were going to freeze up from stage fright before you actually got to the stage. But what if it was an amazing opportunity for you to discuss an authentic passion in front of a very influential audience? Would you still go on stage, knowing you would fail to deliver the message the way you planned?
