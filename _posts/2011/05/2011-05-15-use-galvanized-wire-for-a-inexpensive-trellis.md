When deciding to build a trellis for vines in a garden, one way to save money is to use galvanized wire instead of building the entire trellis entirely using wood. Wood is quite an expensive material to use and is not a very eco-friendly option as well. Galvanized wire does not easily succumb to the damaging effects of weather because it is made of metal. Unlike wood, it does not rot and surely does not wear out so easily.
