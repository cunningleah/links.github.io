Storm is a distributed, reliable, and fault-tolerant stream processing system. Its use cases are so broad that we consider it to be a fundamental new primitive for data processing. That's why we call it the Hadoop of realtime: it does for realtime processing what Hadoop does for batch processing. We are planning to open-source Storm sometime in the next few months.
