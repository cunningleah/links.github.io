Trellis System hardware made from 316 grade stainless steel is offered in 1/8" â€“ 1/4" wire diameters. The system is designed to accommodate cables attaching perpendicular to each other to form a grid pattern. Cable sizes greater than 1/8" utilize the LP104 series posts which have an additional support base for stability. The posts offer a through mounting system for attachment to a surface.
