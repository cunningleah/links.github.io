On Saturday, May 7th, at Best Buy Headquarters in Richfield will be the sixth incarnation of MinneBar — a free and largely decentralized (un) conference aimed at getting those in Minnesota’s tech  and design communities together to discuss topics that interest them.

Registration is now open and so is the opportunity for you to signup to lead a session!

Minne* Community Catalyst Ben Edwards anticipates building off last years attendance of roughly 750, with sights set on a cap of 1,000. “Not only is MinneBar Minnesota’s largest and longest running tech gathering, but also one the largest barcamps across the country,” according to Edwards.

Sessions are segmented into four primary categories: development, startups, design, and hardware — and snake oil salesmen aside — “Off the wall topics are welcome,” says Edwards. There will also be open rooms for planning ad-hoc sessions,     breakout discussions, gaming, or hack fests. “Presenting at MinneBar is one of the best ways to demonstrate knowledge about a particular subject and to connect with other locals who have similar interests.  MinneBar isn’t a typical conference — it’s very discussion oriented and  collaborative, so be prepared to give to get and share what you know.”"

Stay tuned for details on an “off the hook” MinneBar pre-party Friday night May 6th at a TBD location for a slightly more informal way to meet and greet with event participants in advance.

Minne* is in the midst of re-organizing itself as a nonprofit and individual community supporters can show their appreciation one way or the other for the necessary hard work that goes into making it happen — event after event, year after year.   Code42, 8thBridge, ipHouse and Split Rock Partners are on board to sponsor thus far.
