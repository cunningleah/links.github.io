I wrote a script a while back that would watch for changes in my Delicious bookmarks and mirror new ones to .webloc files on my drive, applying OpenMeta tags so that they were locally searchable with Spotlight and other OpenMeta applications. I stopped using Delicious, though, and started using Pinboard, which I mentioned recently that I adore. In the process of revamping the script it became a little more involved than the original.
