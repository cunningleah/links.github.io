The entity with the greatest influence on what Americans cook is not Costco or Trader Joes. Its not the Food Network or The New York Times. Its Google. Every month about a billion of its searches are for recipes. The dishes that its search engine turns up, particularly those on the first page of results, have a huge impact on what Americans cook.
