On account of a comedy show on Tuesday night and the fact that The Colbert Report was all over my intended topic (and did a much better job of the funny than I would have to boot), I am taking the easy way out for the moment. Enjoy one of the rare moments in which something so idiotic and unintentionally hilarious is said on Fox News that Stephen Colbert, a man who has built an entire media career around the ability to play it straight, can't help but break character and laugh his ass off on camera. 

I assume it will surprise no one to learn that the statement in question comes from Fox & Friends.

The suicide rate among the cast and crew on Fox & Friends must be astronomical. 

I gave out free breast exams at Walgreen's a few times. Now I'm not allowed back.
