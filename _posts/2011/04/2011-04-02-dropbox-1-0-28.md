Perennial TidBITS favorite Dropbox has been updated to version 1.0.28. The minor release fixes a rare crash and includes a few other unspecified small tweaks. We tend to find that Dropbox fails to auto-update itself as it should, and indeed, it didn’t do so for me, so I downloaded and installed manually. You can check which version of Dropbox you’re running by hovering your mouse pointer over the Dropbox menu bar icon, or by clicking the icon, choosing Preferences, and then checking the Account tab.
