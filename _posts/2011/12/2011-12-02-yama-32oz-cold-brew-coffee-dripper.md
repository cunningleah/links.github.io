This Cold Drop Coffee Brewer from Yama is gorgeous and would make a lovely addition to your kitchen, not to mention it is a real conversation piece with its height of almost two feet. By slowly brewing coffee with ice water, the harsher oils are not brought out. The final brew from the ice drip process is much more mellow than with “regular” coffee makers.
