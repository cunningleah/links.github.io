The PHP Fog application stack is designed to provide reliability, ease of use, scalability, and speed. From the incoming HTTP request to the delivery of your critical data and features, we’ve baked in redundancies and optimizations in every piece of the stack to deliver reliability and speed. We’ve talked to thousands of customers to understand the pain points and build an infrastructure that automates scalability and makes deployment and management of applications easy. Developers love us, and IT departments need us.
