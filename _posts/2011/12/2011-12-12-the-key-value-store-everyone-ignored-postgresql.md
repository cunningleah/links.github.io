Yes I know you are really happy with your “persistent” Key Value store. But did anybody notice hstore that comes along Postgresql. I find Postgresql to be a really great RDBMS that has been ignored all the time. It even has some great publisher/subscriber system as well (or LISTEN/NOTIFY in terms of Postgresql) that a lot of people may have implement using Redis, RabbitMQ etc. For people who have not lived anything other than MySQL. I would simply ask them to try out Postgres.
