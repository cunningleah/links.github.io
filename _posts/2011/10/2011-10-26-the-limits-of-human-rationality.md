Jonah Lehrer, writing for The New Yorker on Daniel Kahnemans new book, Thinking, Fast and Slow:



  Its impossible to overstate the influence of Kahneman and
Tversky. Like Darwin, they helped to dismantle a longstanding myth
of human exceptionalism. Although wed always seen ourselves as
rational creatures  this was our Promethean gift  it turns out
that human reason is rather feeble, easily overwhelmed by ancient
instincts and lazy biases. The mind is a deeply flawed machine.



Depressing, in a way, but it explains so much of our collective behavior. (Via Kontra.)
