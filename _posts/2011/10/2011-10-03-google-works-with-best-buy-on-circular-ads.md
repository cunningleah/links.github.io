Google Inc. is trying to integrate Sunday-circular type ads into its search results, and it's turning to companies with a lot of experience in that kind of advertising.

Bloomberg reports that Google is working with Richfield-based Best Buy Co. Inc. and Cincinnati-based Macy's Inc.  retailers that have long used print circulars in Sunday newspapers  to test the appeal of its new online ads.

Those promotions, which will include larger type and photos, will start popping up this week. Web surfers will see them when they click on search ads that are shown during Web searches.
