False alarm, for a variety of reasons I have barely touched WeSolver, now I am ready to focus.  Created the to do list and will finish a bit more testing before I invite others to join up but that is next.  Without input I wont know if this is ready to be used effectively by others.  I know I have the alpha testers ready and waiting (thank you Ariane, Anais and Remy!) and will have to recruit more for the beta testing round, this is getting close to real and I am very excited (and nervous).Stay tuned for more frequent updates.Regards,Armistral
