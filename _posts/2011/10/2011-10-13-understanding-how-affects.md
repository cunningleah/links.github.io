I’ve had to simplify a bit, but to make it easier to understand I’ve teamed up with Jess Bachman at Visual.ly. If you want to see a view of the power of their work check out this Steve Jobs infographic.

As “Big Data” becomes more pervasive the power to visualize will become increasingly important.
