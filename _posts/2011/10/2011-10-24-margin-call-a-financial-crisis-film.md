Chandor's film is less a portrait
        of individual malfeasance than of systemic, cultural failure. His characters have made their moral compromises gradually, selling off bits of
        themselves at a loss, piece by piece, until they find that their debts outweigh their assets and the only evident way out is to keep going.
