George Oates is project lead for Open Library, an open-source project of the Internet Archive. It currently provides free bibliographic records for more than 20 million books and direct access to digitized copies for more than 1,700,000 of them. She also is a research associate at the Smithsonian Institution. Before joining the Internet Archive, Oates was the lead designer for Flickr, where she developed The Commons, an archive of unrestricted photographs that are enriched on the site by social tagging. The several dozen institutions that share photos on The Commons now include NASA, The National Archives (UK), George Eastman House, the Smithsonian Institution, and the Library of Congress.
