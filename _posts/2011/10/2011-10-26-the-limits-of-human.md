Jonah Lehrer, writing for The New Yorker on Daniel Kahneman’s new book, Thinking, Fast and Slow:

It’s impossible to overstate the influence of Kahneman and
Tversky. Like Darwin, they helped to dismantle a longstanding myth
of human exceptionalism. Although we’d always seen ourselves as
rational creatures — this was our Promethean gift — it turns out
that human reason is rather feeble, easily overwhelmed by ancient
instincts and lazy biases. The mind is a deeply flawed machine.

Depressing, in a way, but it explains so much of our collective behavior. (Via Kontra.)
