Tammy and Jamie got me a gift certificate for Midwest Photo Safari for my birthday.  I had a very peaceful, 85-degree, fall 3.5-hour tour of Minneapolis today!  We toured around Chute Park, Our Lady of Lourdes Church, Old Saint Anthony Neighborhood, the Historic Pillsbury "A" Mill, the east approach of the Stone Arch Bridge at Hennepin Bluffs Park, Nicollet Island historic area, the Third Avenue Bridge, and Power Park.It was a pretty sunny day for photos, but I learned some new things about my camera and my picture-taking.  I learned about metering and some other camera settings, how to do a little "star" with the sunlight, and I learned that I prefer to take photos of people rather than scenes or things.  It was a good experience--I loved learning the history of that part of Minneapolis!  Also, it was nice to be able to leisurely walk around looking for cool things to photograph and try out different lighting settings or angles.  Here are some of my favorites.  Thanks Thingelstads! Some of my fellow safarians taking shots:)
