Jesse Thorn:



  In 1964, Lyndon Johnson needed pants, so he called the Haggar
clothing company and asked for some. The call was recorded (like
all White House calls at the time), and has since become the stuff
of legend. Johnson’s anatomically specific directions to Mr.
Haggar are some of the most intimate words we’ve ever heard from
the mouth of a President.
