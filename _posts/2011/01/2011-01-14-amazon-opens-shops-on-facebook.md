Its about time that one of the earliest pioneers ofonline commerce openedup shopson Facebook. Today Amazonssubsidiary Quidisi has opened up a few stores selling household items on the social network.   Quidsi, which wasacquired by Amazon for $540 million in the fall,has created electronic commerce pages on Facebook forSoap.com,BeautyBar.comandDiapers.com. These are companies owned by Quidsi, and their social network presence together amounts toabout 60,000fans.  When you go to Soap.coms Facebook page, you see a tab called My List where you can search for and purchaseproducts all withinthe social network.The shopping cart on the site looks like a more sophisticated, cleaner version of the one on Amazon.com, and lets you confirm what you want to purchase. The tool also tracks your order, and encourages you to like the product.  What I found most helpful was the My Lists tab, which let me shop across all of Quidisis destinations (Diapers, Soap, and Beauty Bar), reorder, and customize my shopping list. This seems like a more robust version of FatWallet.  Quidisisomewhat resemblesStorenvyin allowing you to shopfrom stores within a single tab. However, while Storenvy requires you to create aspecific accountfor the application,My Lists just asks you for the login youve previously used on BeautyBar.com, Soap.com, or Diapers.com.  Do you think these Quidisi shops will do well on Facebook, or will stores built by other social commerce vendors fare better?
