rsync.net will also make available, weekly, a "warrant canary" in the form of a cryptographically signed message containing the following: a declaration that, up to that point, no warrants have been served, nor have any searches or seizures taken place; a cut and paste headline from a major news source, establishing date. Special note should be taken if these messages ever cease being updated, or are removed from this page.
