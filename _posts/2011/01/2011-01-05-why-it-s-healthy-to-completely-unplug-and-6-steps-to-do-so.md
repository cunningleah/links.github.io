I'm probably a good example of what you'd call a web junkie. I'm connected to the web almost all the time, whether I'm at home, working or on the go. For one, a lot of my work is based online. I run a personal development blog which I update regularly; I do 1-1 coaching with international clients via Skype and recently I started courses online too. In my leisure time, I surf interesting sites, watch online videos and chat with others. When I've nothing to do, my first instinct is get on the web to see what's available.
