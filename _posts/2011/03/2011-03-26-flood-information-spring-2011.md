This has been one of the snowiest winters for Minneapolis on record. As that snow accumulation melts, some properties will be at an increased risk of flooding. City of Minneapolis Public Works and Emergency Management staff have been working with the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), as well as local watershed management organizations and the National Weather Service (NWS) to prepare for the situation.
