After a decade with Speakeasy, I switched to Qwest for my DSL. 

From what I understand, Qwest has fiber running to the my block with copper the house. Additionally as I understand – this switch from copper to fiber means Qwest is no longer compelled to make bandwidth available to resellers like Speakeasy. 

The copper turns into WiFi once it gets inside my house, then down the basement to me.  I’ve got sneaking suspicion that I could squeak out a few more Mbs and shorten the ping times by moving the phone jack downstairs and running ethernet to my primary machine. 

The first few days, the throughputs were highly erratic but everything seems to have stabilized quite nicely.
