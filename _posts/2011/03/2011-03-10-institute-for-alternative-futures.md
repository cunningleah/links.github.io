The Institute for Alternative Futures (IAF) is a leader in the creation of preferred futures. Since its founding in 1977 by Clement Bezold, Alvin Toffler and James Dator, IAF has helped organizations monitor trends, explore future possibilities and create the futures they prefer. IAF draws on a robust selection of futures methodologies, such as environmental scans, forecasts, scenarios, visioning and its own "aspirational futures" technique. Past clients include the World Health Organization, the Department of Health and Human Services, the Environmental Protection Agency, AARP, and the American Cancer Society.
