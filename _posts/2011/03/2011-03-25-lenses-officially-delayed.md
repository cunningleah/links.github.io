Probably not a shocker
Canon has officially delayed the EF 8-15 f/4L Fisheye, EF 300 f/2.8L IS II & EF 400 f/2.8L IS II.

The new date? No one knows.

A bigtime lens guy said he expects to see “an abominable snowman riding a unicorn” before he sees the new fisheye.

I think June/July at the earliest now.
