Its a good day to name a chief digital officer. Hours after Gannett (NYSE: GCI) named David Payne as its new CDO, Forbes Media says it promoting Michael Smith from chief technology officer to its first chief digital officer.

Smith will keep his current operating responsibilities as president of Forbes.com As he takes on the added duties of CDO, Smith will also be tasked with reorganizing of all Forbes IT departments which include IT Systems, Multi-Platform Development and Digital Strategy. Smith will report directly to Scott Masterson, Forbes Medias SVP/GM.


Among his other duties, Smith will run the Forbes Media Exchange, the companys ad bidding platform, As Masterson said in a statement, Mike has initiated many products while at Forbes but none with more potential than FMX.
 
Before taking on the Forbes.com CTO post, Smith was VP and chief information officer at TheStreet.com (NSDQ: TSCM). Hes also worked  at HBO in a variety of positions, including director of Information Technology.


Since last spring, Forbes has been working to overhaul its digital and edit sides. In May, Forbes acquired the freelance aggregation site True/Slant and brought in its founder and former Forbes editor Lewis DVorkin to run content strategy.
