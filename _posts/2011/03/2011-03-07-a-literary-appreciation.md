You will probably never need to know about the Olson database, also known as the Zoneinfo or tz database. And were it not for my elmcity project I never would have looked into it. I knew roughly that this bedrock database is a compendium of definitions of the worldâ€™s timezones, plus rules for daylight savings transitions (DST), used by many operating systems and programming languages.
