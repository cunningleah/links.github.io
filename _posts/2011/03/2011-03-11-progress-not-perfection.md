We are moving slow but moving.  Phil and Scott are over their major hump at work which will help some, Phil is evolving the IA and incorporating projects, resources and problem/solution sets.  Doug and Jason and Kevin will see some improvement in availability in less than a month (hopefully) not that they are not doing what they can despite the incredible effort their day job is taking at the moment as illustrated here.  Jason has a few links of interest and Dante has created an amazing first cut of design...here.  Please take a look, it fucking rocks.Scrums have been sucking but that is ok, I know they will kick in when it is truly time for them to.  Actual progress, even... dare I say momentum is in evidence and real velocity is coming, I can feel it.Please let me know if you have any questions about anything or any comments on the mission statement (current draft I think needs reference to emergencies) here.Just want you all to know that it is incredible to watch this happen.Thank you.
