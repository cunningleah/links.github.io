The AlienBees B800 is a powerful, self-contained studio flash unit, producing 320 true wattseconds of power, with 14,000 lumenseconds of output. The power is independently adjustable with 6 stops of stepless power variability from Full down to 1/32nd of the total power, in whole f-stop increments, and everywhere in between. This flashpower is independently adjusted on the back control panel, with a slide fader that shows marked f-stop increments. Utilizing advanced durability flash capacitors, coupled with axial-flow thermodynamics, the B800 minimizes heat build-up, has increased overall durability, and shorter flash durations.
