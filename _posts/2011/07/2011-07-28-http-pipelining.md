HTTP pipelining has been around for quite a while  since HTTP/1.1 was introduced. When using pipelining, an HTTP client may send multiple requests on the same connection, without waiting for the server to respond. Doing so practically eliminates the round-trip time (RTT) overhead of all but the first request, especially if the server responds quickly.
