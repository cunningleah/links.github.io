This post is not about devops, it's not about lean startups, it's not about web scale, it's not about the cloud, and it's not about continuous deployment. This post is about you, the developer who's main purpose in life has always been to build great web applications. In a pretty traditional world you write code, you write tests for it, you deploy, and you go home. Until now.
