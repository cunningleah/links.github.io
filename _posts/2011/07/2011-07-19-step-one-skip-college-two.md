At  the ripe age of 18 and while still in high school, entrepreneur Nathan  Reimnitz picked up a copy of “Freakonomics” and made a conscious decision to skip the traditional college path.

Instead, he (politely) passed on MIT, curtailed his skateboarding business, and went to work full steam on tackling a  much bigger industry in dire need of innovation — Real Estate.

Reimnitz,  now 22,  initially started his business in 2007 as a ‘for sale by owner  (FSBO)’ concept that would allow property renters and sellers to  leverage the marketing capabilities of technology without the need of a  realtor. “The book had a chapter about agents…a middleman whose  interests were actually their own, first and foremost,” he recalls.   Initially named and modeled after CarSoup, VillaSoup reached revenue  within two weeks by automating FSBO listings across a network of dozens  of classified sites for a flat fee.

“Our  goal at the time, as it remains today, is to help as many rent or sell  their homes by having access to others who are searching for real  estate,” he says. “Although nowadays, we work with agents much more than  we do against them,” he admits, testifying to the degree that services  like his have leveled the playing field for the customer over the  years.  “…and getting our start during the real estate crash was  actually a good thing for a company like ours who assist sellers with maximizing  their profits.”

Today, the newly re-branded SyncMyAd is a SaaS built on that same simple premise — uniting sellers and  renters (whether individual, agency, or managers) — with potential  buyers via automation tools.  The firm has continued to thrive with the  kind of results that come from years of learning, venture capital investment via Space Center Ventures, and a  business marriage with partner Dustin Griess (left).



Proving  to be successful is a control panel which allows property managers to  maintain a consistent message for their property across multiple online  websites on their own. Here, an interface allows customers to manage  property descriptions, photos, amenities, floor plans, and rent prices.

Once  a new customer has signed up and the property data is loaded into the  system, it is automatically shared with up to 1,500 websites through  classifieds, search engines, social networking sites, and ILS listing  services (multi-services). While never too specific on what the secret  sauce is, Reimnitz notes that “…with a high level of syndication, our  customers can be confident that their listings receive maximum exposure  across the web.”

SyncMyAd  customers are able to select from one of two subscription-based models:  ‘single family’ or ‘multi-unit’, both of which currently run $39.95 per  month. For $79/month, they can upgrade to a Pro versions and obtain  additional features like premium placement, a phone tracking tool and an  ILS updater tool.

While  competition exists in this space, SyncMyAd cites many advantages,  including being one of the first to market in the space as well as  “uniquely robust syndication capabilities” through strong partnerships  with companies like Cazoodle.com.

“I  have never been the type of person to sit down and listen to someone  teach me,” says Reimnitz, “I would rather go out and start my own thing  and learn from my mistakes in the real world.”

Perhaps other young and aspiring local entrepreneurs can find inspiration and confidence in Remnitz’s success.
