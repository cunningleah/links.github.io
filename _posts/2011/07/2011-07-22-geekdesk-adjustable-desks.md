After three years on the market, and worldwide acclaim, the GeekDesk® Original and GeekDesk® Mini (i.e. GeekDesk® “Version 1”) is updated with the most popular requests received from our customers: More powerful lifting capacity, 32% greater adjustment range, even greater stability and rigidity, and available in two colors -- all at the same great price. The v2 is the next step in GeekDesk®’s evolution as a leader in simple, well-designed, high-quality quick-adjustable desks.
