This PHP Chart for MediaWiki extension (pchart4mw)[1] allows you to visualize your data with charts like line-, bar-, pie-, radar-, scatter- and bubble charts. It uses the (free) PHP Chart library pChart[2] to produce the charts. It allows for 2- or 3-dimensional charts, which are all within the potential of the pChart library. The charts are based on your data from the wiki page.
