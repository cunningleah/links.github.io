The NYSE’s domination of U.S. stock trading is gone, too. Once it handled 82 percent of the share volume involving companies it listed, with most of those deals done by brokers in colored smocks shouting orders on the exchange floor. Now the NYSE and a sister exchange’s shrunken 35 percent share of those transactions is executed mainly by computer servers stacked in a brick building in suburban Mahwah, New Jersey, about 33 miles (53 kilometers) from Wall Street. What mostly remains at the neoclassical Manhattan headquarters is a TV stage where business executives and celebrities such as Miss USA or Snooki from MTV’s “Jersey Shore” ring open and close trading sessions.
