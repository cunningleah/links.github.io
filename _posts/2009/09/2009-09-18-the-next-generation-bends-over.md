Mints sale to Intuit really pissed me off.



Why should I care? Because I think its indicative of a VC-induced cancer thats infecting our industry and killing off the next generation. I dont know the full backstory, but Id bet this sale was encouraged by a Mint investor.



Heres a fresh new company that was gunning for an aging incumbent. And not only gunning, but gaining. They had a great product, great design, and great potential. They were growing rapidly and figured out the revenue game. They were on their way to redefining an industry  one that was left for dead by the current custodians.



They were everything their main competitor, Intuit, was not. While Mint was inventing, Intuit was out of it. People used Quickbooks/Quicken out of habit and legacy. People used Mint because they loved it. Intuit was disgruntled, Mint was disruptive.
