Timothy Armes has just released version 4.00 of LR2/Mogrify – his Lightroom plugin for adding watermarks, text annotations and borders to exported images (among lots of other things).

This version adds quite a few features that users have been asking him for:
There’s a new “Canvas” section for placing the (resized) image onto a fixed size canvas. Useful when images have to have a fixed size but you don’t wish to crop them (such as for sending them to photo labs or displaying them on a digital projector).
Multiple different watermarks may now be added to an image.
PNG watermarks may now be scaled proportionally.
Watermarks can now be specified as a percentage of the width or height of the image while preserving the aspect ratio.
Horizontal/Vertical insets now work in each of the nine watermark positions.
The limit of 3 text annotations has been removed – add as many as you want.
Fixed a recent bug that stopped TIFF’s being exported in 8-bit mode.
Fixed a recent bug that stopped borders having no width or height.
