David Pogue tweets (update: MacOSXHints had it yesterday) a pretty cool little tip for those of you who've upgraded to Snow Leopard: <Option-clicking> on the sound menu item at the top of the screen allows you to quickly change your sound input and output options.  Before, you'd have to go into System Preferences and Sound and check options from there.  This is especially good when getting a Skype call or other other sound emergancy.  See menu to the right ---->

As you probably already know, option clicking the battery menu item gives you your battery condition and option clicking on the Time Machine menu item shows you other Time Machine disks.  Option Clicking on the Bluetooth menu gives you access to the PacketLogger and Bluetooth Browser.




Snow Leopard is still on sale at Amazon for $25.
