In an email today, Lazyfeed cofounder and CEO Ethan Gahng informed us that the RSS reader is now supporting both RSSCloud and PubSubHubBub protocols, allowing for real-time integration of Wordpress, Blogger, Typepad, and Feedburner content.


"Our internal tests show that the service has actually become significantly faster," Gahng wrote. "Now some content from as recent as several seconds ago is being notified through Lazyfeed."

Lazyfeed is a feed reader intended for the ever-growing market of, as we wrote previously, "those of us who are too lazy for RSS feeds but still in the market for real-time, personalized blog searches." Internally, we've found the site incredibly useful. "To be frank, it's been so useful in churning up news items that I've been hesitant to discuss it publicly," Marshall Kirkpatrick wrote in a recent post.


Just a few days ago, we wrote about Lazyfeed's announcing support for RSSCloud. Lazyfeed was the first feed reader after RSSCloud creator Dave Winer's own software called River2 to support the new protocol, which added a real-time element to RSS feeds from, among other sources, Wordpress blogs.


Additional implementation of PubSubHubBub allows for real-time content from Atom feeds, including Typepad blogs, Blogger blogs, and Feedburner content. "It is now really like an instant messenger, " wrote Gahng in a blog post.


Gahng went on to discuss the issue of real-time Feedburner content, saying, "It seems that Feedburner itself is not real-time. Right now, all content from Feedburner-hosted blogs is not being collected in real time. It seems that the feed is updated several minutes after the actual post is published.


He further suggested a "relay of two real-time notifications" between a blog and the Feedburner server through either of the real-time feed protocols.
