Google may be in talks to acquire video company Brightcove for between $500 and 700 million, according to PBS’ Mark Glaser.

Brightcove, which gives media outlets and other businesses a platform to deliver online video, declined to comment.

Such an acquisition would give the search giant Brightcove’s technology plus its relationships with content providers from The New York Times to Universal Music Group as it pushes YouTube toward profitability. The company’s CEO Jeremy Allaire was in San Francisco Bay Area last week to promote Brightcove’s alliance of distribution and technology partners.

Brightcove has raised $91 million to date from investors including General Catalyst Partners and AOL.
