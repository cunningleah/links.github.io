Just when it seems the music industry is starting to come around to the realities of digital distribution, groups representing songwriters, composers, and music publishers are hoping to tack on additional licensing feesto music downloaded online. If fact, the group would like to earn performances fees even from the 30-second previews you can hear when you browse the iTunes Store.


Licensing issues with iTunes or other digital distributors is nothing new. The complexities of licensing are a major part of the reason why many countries can't buy or rent movies from the iTunes Store, why DVDs of TV shows and sometimes movies are released with alternate music, and why some episodes of TV shows aren't available for streaming via Netflix's Watch Instantly feature.
