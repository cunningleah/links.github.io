This is one of many millions of blogs on wordpress.com.
Here is its RSS feed.
View source on that.
Notice anything interesting? 
ReadWriteWeb: "All blogs on the WordPress.com platform and any WordPress.org blogs that opt-in will now make instant updates available to any RSS readers subscribed to a new feature called RSSCloud. There is currently only one RSS aggregator that supports RSSCloud, Dave Winer's brand-new reader River2. That will probably change very soon."
Apparently for some people this is the first time they're hearing about the <cloud> element in RSS. It first appeared in January 2001 and was part of RSS 0.92, and of course RSS 2.0.. It was fully supported in Radio UserLand 8.0 and Manila. 
Also, many thanks to Matt Mullenweg and Toni Schneider at Automattic, and the rest of the guys. It's so cool to have them in the tech industry. We all owe them a lot for their support of open formats and protocols. 
InBerkeley is cloud-enabled. And it works! Real-time, baby. 
Any Wordpress blog can be cloud-enabled, not just the ones on wordpress.com. I wonder which major tech blog is going to be first to go cloud.
Also it would be great if Twitter clients, such as Seesmic and Brizzly, would start thinking about supporting rssCloud.
