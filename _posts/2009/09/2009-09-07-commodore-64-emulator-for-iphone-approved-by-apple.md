Remember the Commodore 64 emulator app that was initially rejected from the App Store? With changes, it’s now accepted and available for $5. (One of the changes was to hide the BASIC interpreter, alas.) Aron Allen has a nice interview with the app’s lead developer.


Update: Rene Ritchie details how to access the hidden BASIC interpreter.
