Lightroom 2.5 and Camera Raw 5.5 are now available as final releases on Adobe.com and through the update mechanisms available in Photoshop CS4 and Lightroom 2.  These updates include camera support for the following models:



Nikon D300s
Nikon D3000
Olympus E-P1
Panasonic DMC-FZ35** 
Panasonic DMC-GF1


**Note that in Europe and Japan this model is marketed as the DMC-FZ38.  Unfortunately, due to a metadata difference between these cameras, files from the DMC-FZ38 will *not* be supported until the next Camera Raw and Lightroom updates.


Release Notes:

Camera Raw 5.5 and Lightroom 2.5 include a correction to the demosaic algorithms for Bayer sensor cameras with unequal green response.  Olympus, Panasonic and Sony are among the more popular camera manufacturers affected by this change. But the demosaic correction provides only a subtle visual improvement to the processing of those raw files.
Lightroom 2.5 corrects for the following problem in Lightroom 2.4.  Lightroom 2.4 on Windows continued to display the import dialog when a memory card was detected regardless of the preference setting "Show import dialog when a memory card is detected."
Thank you to everyone who provided feedback on our Camera Raw 5.5 Release Candidate.
