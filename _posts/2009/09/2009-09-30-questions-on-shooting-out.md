If you haven’t seen it yet, you should head over to Dan Chung’s DSLR News Shooter blog.  He’s creating a great resource for anyone using DSLRs to shoot HD video. We’re excited to see this blog develop- we’re still trying to figure this relatively new world of DSLR video out ourselves, and his behind the scenes looks at how he’s doing work are super-helpful.  

You can check out the amazing 1080p footage of “Another Night in Beijing”, shot with the new Canon Eos7D, and weigh in on whether rolling shutter matters for news audiences. There’s also a great video on rigging up a new 7D (if you thought you were going to shoot great video straight out of the box, think again). 

If you aren’t familiar with Dan’s work, head over to the Guardian site and watch some of his stories.  He’s a stellar journalist, and we’re really looking forward to seeing his blog evolve.
