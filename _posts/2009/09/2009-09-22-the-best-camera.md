Since the moment he got his iPhone, Chase Jarvis has been snapping like mad living up to the meme of the best camera is the one you have with you. If you couldn't guess, I totally agree with him, having been pushing out a lot of iPhone photography myself. Well, now he's gone and pushed up the game by collaboration with some software devs and putting together both a new iPhone photo processing application and social website.





The application is definitely nice. It features several push button filters that give great looks. And, in a twist, the filter sets work as a stack and you can reorder them on the fly if you want. Once you've got the photo you want, the app manages pushing it to Twitter, the Best Camera website, and Facebook for you. One of the neat features about the Best Camera website is that you can see what filters photographer applied to the photograph.





For a 1.0 app, it's got a high amount of fit and finish. The only functional thing I've seen that you need to be careful of is the maximum size you process images at. Working with full size images really drags things down. It's better to stick to 800x800 or so. I'm just about to dart off a suggestion list to Chase for the next version (including *cough* metadata handling), but you can bet I'll be using Best Camera a lot.
