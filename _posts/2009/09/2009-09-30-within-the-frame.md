The book by David DuChemin called “Within the Frame” is about finding and expressing your photographic vision, specifically where people, places, and cultures are concerned. The book on its own is great and I can highly recommend it.

However I recently discovered that after producing the book David recorded a series of podcasts for peachpit press which you can also view online. In the podcasts he picks a one or two images submitted to the “Within the Frame” Flickr-group and provides a critique. The useful thing is these reviews are not so much technical as compositional – pointing out where a certain angle or crop might have worked better, and highlighting those elements within the shot that work well.

You can view all the podcasts (there’s 17 of them to date) by following the link below.
