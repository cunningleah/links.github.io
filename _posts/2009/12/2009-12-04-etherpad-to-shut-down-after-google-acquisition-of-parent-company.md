No more new accounts, and the existing EtherPad service is scheduled to shut down March 31. The team is joining Google’s Wave team. If you want my opinion, it ought to be the other way around: keep EtherPad going and abandon Wave. As Glenn Fleishman writes:



  I’ve been using [Google Wave] for some weeks, and still find it
  baffling, where EtherPad was instantly explicable and useful. I
  hope the AppJet team brings its approach with them.
