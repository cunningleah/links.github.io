At left, is tight crop of a Black Widow that I found this morning.

If you look closely, you can see my reflection on its back (below the mouth bits — it is upside down).

The ring like reflection is the ring flash on my the  Canon 100mm macro lens used to take the picture.  The bluish-white blob to the right of that is me;  my shirt, mostly.



Same shot.  Not so cropped.

This particular Black Widow is living in the neighbor’s bed of clover.  She is clearly quite hungry in that Black Widow’s are rarely so aggressive.  This one would pop out of her hidey-hole at the slightest bit of motion on the web.

I got this particular shot by using a stick to jiggle the web like an insect would.

Beautiful creature, really.  Just wish it didn’t live quite so close to where the neighborhood kids play.  Thus, it’ll likely be dead by sundown.



 A went back and visited Ms. Widow a bit later and discovered that I could get her to come out in the open by jiggling her web with my finger.  Slightly unnerving as she approached my finger, but then she decided to hang out in the open.

Thus, I was able to capture the image at left.  It is an uncropped, full 15 megapixel, image of the black widow as she hung upside down in her web.

Best viewed at full size and then scaled to fit your monitor.

She then proceeded to hang out and fix her web.  Thus, I ended up with a gallery of action shots, spinnerets and all.  I didn’t know that black widows have hairy backs.
