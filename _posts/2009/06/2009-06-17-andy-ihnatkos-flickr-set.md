Vastly improved optical quality over the old camera, but I think the real win is the software touch interface for setting the focus and exposure point. The quality here is high enough that I’m wondering whether I’ll ever buy another point-and-shoot camera — an iPhone for the pocket and an SLR kit for quality seem like the way to go.


Update: Check out the detailed metadata on the pictures — even includes compass direction.
