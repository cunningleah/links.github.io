I dont care how good you are at programming, finding bugs, whatever. If youre rude, or if you speak poorly to people who dont understand your quirks. you will wind up being shunted to the side. No one wants to work with someone who makes them feel beat down all the time, or someone who they simply cant understand, or someone whose reaction to every issue is to start wailing about the end of the world.

Excellent advice I need more and more of, everyday.
