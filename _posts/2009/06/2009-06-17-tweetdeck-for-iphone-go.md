Kevin Rose is reporting that the iPhone version of the popular Twitter client TweetDeck is set to be launched tonight (Tuesday, June 16th) at 9 PM PDT. Although the free app will officially be announced at that time, availability is totally dependent on the whims of the App Store. Rose's leak of the app's impending release did not include any precognition of when the app will actually make it into our hands, nor was price information available.Mashable notes that TweetDeck for iPhone reflects many of the features of the desktop version, including multiple column-based friend groups and a beautiful user interface. TweetDeck for iPhone syncs with the desktop version, and is expected to provide the following features:

    Shake to refresh
    Support for multiple accounts
    Flick to move between columns
    Status updates similar to Facebook toolbar

It was mentioned in our email discussions about this app that it's interesting to see a Cocoa Touch version of Tweetdeck before a Cocoa (Mac OS X) version; the desktop app is cross-platform and runs atop the Adobe AIR framework. Whether TweetDeck has the mojo to kick Twittelator off of my iPhone home screen remains to be seen. How about you, TUAW readers? What's your favorite Twitter app?Update: Well, it looks like a number of blogs leaked the news, and TweetDeck for iPhone is now available for download in the App Store.
