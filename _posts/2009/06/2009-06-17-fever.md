New web-based feed reader from Shaun Inman. It’s gorgeous, of course, and the interaction design is quite different than that of any other feed reader I’ve seen. But what most interests me is the business model — like Inman’s Mint, Fever is not a hosted service but rather a PHP/MySQL app you install and run on your own server, with a one-time fee of $30. The model is like that of desktop software.
