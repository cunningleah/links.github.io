Steven Troughton-Smith:



  I gave up Tuesday eve because I couldn’t get the device into
  restore mode no matter what I did, but on Wednesday morning I
  figured it out: you have to hold the volume-up button while the
  device is off before plugging it into USB, and from there you can
  use Palm’s firmware flashers to do whatever you like with it. As
  the device can run unsigned firmware (!!!) I was easily able to
  hack out the activation check, and get up and running and enable
  the root shell. In that respect, I may just have the first
  jailbroken Pre in existence.
