From the Toys Section:

Best Buy offers the Canon EOS 5D Mark II 21.1-Megapixel Digital SLR Camera Body, model no. 2764B003, for $2,499.99. (Add it to your cart to get this price.) With free shipping, that's $199 under our April mention and the lowest total price we've seen. Sales tax is added where applicable. The 5D Mark II features a 3" LCD, 3.9 frames per second burst mode, "Live View" (for framing pictures with the LCD), 30fps 1080p HD video capture with sound (unusual for an SLR), USB 2.0 connectivity, magnesium alloy exterior, and EOS Integrated Cleaning system which includes a self-cleaning sensor unit.

There was also a recent update to add manual exposure control for video recording.
