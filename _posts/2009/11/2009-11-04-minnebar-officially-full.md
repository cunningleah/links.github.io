After releasing the last few tickets we could scrounge up the 2009 MinneBar (un)conference is now full.  In the week leading up to the event we will ask that anyone who has a ticket but knows they will not be able to make it let us know so we can release a few more that week.

Luke and I and the rest of the team are very excited for this event. There is a slight twist on the format as we are only running sessions from 10 to 4 (usually 9-5 or 5:30) and then going to follow it up with an early happy hour from 4 to ??.

As we solidify the logistics, food, schedule, etc please check out the session wiki pages and be sure to both volunteer to lead discussions on topics that interest you as well as add your name as interested to the sessions already on the wiki. Since we have had such an influx of interest and many first-time barcamp participants, Luke and I are going to be helping to steer first-time session leaders in the right direction to make sure they get the spirit of the event. Let us know if you have questions and be sure to sign up for the mailing list if you have not.
