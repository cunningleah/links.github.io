Dow Jones has unloaded its stake in European index provider Stoxx—in what is likely the first of several divestitures for the company under owner News Corp (NYSE: NWS). Dow Jones is selling its one-third interest in Stoxx, which operates the Dow Jones Stoxx Indices, to partners Deutsche Boerse and SIX Swiss Exchange for $309 million, in addition to $44 million depending on its “future business performance.”
