I have seen so many young entrepreneurs and intelligent, experienced engineers come through the door with great products that will change the way people and businesses function and most of them fail. They fail because the mentality towards what a business should be and how it should be run is different now. Years ago when you opened a business you had fixed costs and you hustled each month to cover bills and grow so that you could do more than just cover bills soon. Technology is not an industry, in my opinion, it is a tool that is used to make an industry more efficient and effective now I know this means that the production of these tools is an industry, but how many companies today really create tools and how many create cool crap that is dead in 6 months?



Investors use terms like sexy and viral and 22 year old CEOs use buzz terms like scalable, robust and enterprise but there is no meat to anything anyone is saying. No one asks how do you make money, how quickly, how much, what are your CPCA oh and 22 and you are a CEO really get over yourself



The illusion of success, the delusion of being the next Zuckerberg are we fostering great minds or setting the next generation up for failure and disappointment?
