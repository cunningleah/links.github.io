Rogue Amoeba submitted a small bug fix update to Airfoil Speakers Touch in July. It wasnt accepted until this week. The reason: when you use it to stream audio from a Mac on your local network, it (a) shows a picture of the type of Mac doing the streaming, and (b) shows a small icon of the app on the Mac playing the audio. Version 1.0 did these things and was in the Store. Version 1.0.1 did the exact same things and was not accepted.


Paul Kafasis:



  Rogue Amoeba no longer has any plans for additional iPhone
  applications, and updates to our existing iPhone applications will
  likely be rare. The iPhone platform had great promise, but that
  promise is not enough, so were focusing on the Mac.



At a certain point good developers are just going to say, I dont need this. Also, judging from the comments on the piece from die-hard defenders of the App Store, theres clearly a misconception about where these images of Mac computers and app icons are coming from. These images  which, yes, are copyrighted by Apple  are not stored within the Airfoil Speakers Touch application. They are being sent from Airfoil on the Mac over the network, live, as the audio streams. Airfoil on the Mac is using public APIs do get these images. Its nonsense. Its like if you wrote a VNC client for the iPhone and Apple rejected it because when you connect to the display of a remote Mac, you can see Apple trademarked icons in the Dock.
