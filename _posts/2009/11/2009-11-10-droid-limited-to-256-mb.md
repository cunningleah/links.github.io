Taylor Wimberly:



  The Motorola Droid will be the most powerful Android phone to date
  when it launches on November 6, 2009. However, the device still
  features the same shortcomings of all other Android phones. The
  Droid ships with a 512 MB ROM which contains only 256 MB available
  for app storage.

  
  Google does not support installing apps to the SD card (and likely
  never will), so developers are limited in what they can create.



This is another one of those things where I simply don’t understand why Motorola doesn’t follow Apple’s lead and provide ample built-in storage rather than relying on removable SD cards. I just checked, and I have about 1.8 gigabytes of apps installed on my iPhone.  Many of the top iPhone games weigh in at 50 or even 100 MB each. My two biggest games alone (Texas Hold’em and Need for Speed Undercover) weigh in at just over 256 MB combined. Just two games.


Did Motorola even look at the size of popular apps in the App Store before releasing this?
