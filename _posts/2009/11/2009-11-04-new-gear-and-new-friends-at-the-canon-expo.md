I’m just back from the UK after speaking at the Canon Pro Solutions Expo in London.  It was really great to meet those who managed to attend and good to catch up with some old friends, too.  I finally met the very talented 5DmkII shooter Danfung Dennis and got to see a bit more of his upcoming documentary from Afghanistan – it’s looking seriously good.
