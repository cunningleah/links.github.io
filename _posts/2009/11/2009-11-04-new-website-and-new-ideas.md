Luke Francl, Matt Thompson, Jeff Pesek and I have all been busy coming up with how best our communities can be served by minne* and the events and opportunities we have all come to love in the Twin Cities. This site is the first step towards getting those thoughts out to everyone in our communities and towards keeping our community flourishing in between the minnebar and minnedemo events throughout the year.
