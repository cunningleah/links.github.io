“An elegant little word processor” is the perfect slogan for this new app by Ross Carter — a $40 writing app for Mac OS X with a thoughtful UI designed to stay out of your way, with a focus on helping you produce beautiful typographic output. The native file format is PDF, so there’s no document format lock-in.


I know it sounds crazy to launch a new word processor today. But Pagehand is a labor of love, and is definitely worth a look.
