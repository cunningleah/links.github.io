It was to be expected that with the success of Apple’s App Store, that others of its type would follow. A number of mobile app stores have launched, but IDFusion’s Bodega is one of the first to launch for the desktop. With roughly 150 apps at launch, a number of big names have signed on-board, let’s take a first look at the Bodega App Store.

At first Glance, the app appears to be more than it is. While the store has a great sidebar, I found the interface a bit sluggish (it’s obviously loading all of the app data from the net), and sometimes unresponsive when I tried browse into an app’s info page. The navigation arrows normally found at the top of apps, were kicked to the bottom (likely because of the giant branded awning), and took a few minutes to get used to clicking at the bottom.


The Bodega interface is slick, except for the exceptionally tacky awning (which you can’t get rid of unfortunately).

I perused the categories, surprised to find a wide spread of apps I hadn’t come across. However I was extremely disappointed to find out that Bodega isn’t really a store, but more of an app aggregator. There’s no built-in payment system that we’ve associated with the iPhone App Store. Instead of being brought through to a payment page, I was crushed to see a little tiny browser pop out of the top, and open the developers site.

Bodega merely links you to the developers website to use their custom payment system

Why use Bodega then instead of simply going to the developers site? Well Bodega does help you save your receipt and license inside the app, but it also works as an update manager. If you have software installed that’s also in the Bodega store, it will show up in an Application list with any available updates. There are also rating and review features similar to Apple’s App Store, which allow users to rate and give feedback on apps.

This is a great first start, but Bodega isn’t the true app store that you would expect it to be. On the Bodega website IDFusion touts the direct-from-developer system as a feature:


“Bodega lets you buy direct from developers, so you’re certain to get the lowest price while making sure your software dollars end up in the pockets of hard-working programmers, not middlemen.”


However, this complicates the purchase process. It’s like going to a big retail store, and being told you have to drive across town to pay for a product.

Hopefully in Bodega 2, or other app stores, we’ll get the one-stop experience we’ve grown accustomed to in Apple’s App Store.
