The Facebook 3.0 iPhone application is finally available for download in the iTunes store. Though the app was submitted to Apple on Aug. 16, its release has been widely anticipated for months by iPhone users (especially Om).

When we took it out for a test drive, we found that its made huge strides over the previous version when it comes to replicating what the full Facebook user experience is like. Not only can you view and RSVP to events, but the Like function is now available. Still, we hope the next version will let us create an event and invite friends directly from our iPhones.

But one of the best new features is the ability to send texts and call your Facebook friends directly from the app, a functionality thats been in the works for awhile. Not only is the address book integration handy, but it brings Facebook closer to mirroring real-world relationships, just as Liz predicted it would more than a year ago.

While iPhone users can now create and upload photos directly to the app, the time it takes to thumb through friends photo albums was still a bit long because it took a few seconds for the photos to load each time.

Overall, the less-cluttered user interface makes it easier to quickly navigate around the app. Though its still missing some functions, this app is a notable improvement from the previous version. Readers, what do you think of it? Please share your reviews in the comments section.
