A few readers have mentioned that their Snow Leopard shipments have been locked in and are still expected to arrive on August 28th.  They can no longer make changes to the order.


"My snow leopard disc went to "PREPARED FOR SHIPMENT" today... can't modify or cancel it anymore :-)" 


The Apple Store still has an email reminder for Snow Leopard.  Amazon, the only retailer taking pre-orders, prices are still as follows:

10.6 Snow Leopard: $29
Family Pack (5-User): $49
Box Set (SL, iLife, iWork):$169
Box Set Family Pack (5U):$229
Snow Leopard Server  $499
