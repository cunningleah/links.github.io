Americans, and this probably means you, eat way too much sugar:



Most of that added sugar comes from soft drinks and candy â€” a whopping 355 calories and the equivalent of guzzling two cans of soda and eating a chocolate bar.



I seem to be an oddity in that I never drink soda, eat candy, or add sugar to things.
