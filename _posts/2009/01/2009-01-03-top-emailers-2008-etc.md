As an update to last year’s post:


Toni Schneider — 1,052
Maya Desai — 826
Mom — 659
Raanan Bar-Cohen — 452
Donncha O Caoimh — 424
Barry Abrahamson — 386
Mark Riley — 222
Jane Wells — 218
Ryan Boren — 200
Andrew Ozz — 197
Matt Thomas — 193
Liz Danzico — 148
Mike Hirshland — 144
Heather Rasley — 139
Joseph Scott — 129

I’ve expanded the list to 15. A lot of the same folks at the very top, but new faces in Liz and Jane from 2.5 and 2.7 usability cycles. Also three people on the list have changed their domain in the past year, just like I did. It must have been a year for that.

Also for fun here are some yearly posting stats courtesy of Alex’s queries:

As you can see I’m doing fewer posts with fewer words than ever, but getting more comments. At this rate I’ll be down to 40 words per post next year. Yay brevity.  

Working on collating some travel / WordCamp stats.
