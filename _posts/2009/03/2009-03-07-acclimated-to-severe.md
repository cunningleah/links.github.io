Philip Greenspun:



  This evening’s New York Times was worrisome. An inset box showed that the S&P 500 had fallen 4.25 percent for the day, wiping out roughly a year of investment returns. A few months ago this would have been the top story. Today, however, it did not even make the front page.



For context, consider this, from Harper’s Index:



  Number of times in 2008 that the S&P 500 closed up or down 5 percent in a single day: 17

  
  Number of times between 1956 and 2007 it did this: 17
