Nora, Max and I had a fun Saturday at the Thingelstads. They made baked ziti and blondies for lunch and then Mazie and Nora had a photo shoot in the basement. Jamie has all the professional equipment and they had tons of fun props! Mazie was a better model than Nora.  Even so, Jamie got some great shots of the ever-moving Nora.
