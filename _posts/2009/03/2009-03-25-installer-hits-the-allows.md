Dan Moren at Macworld reports on an interesting development in the Jailbreaking wars.  Installer.app now has a desktop application that lets you install those nasty jailbroken apps directly from the desktop...without jailbreaking your precious iPhone. The application looks like iTunes and works almost as easily. If we weren't rocking the 3.0 firmware, we'd be testing this right now. Anyone out there want to be the guinea pigs?
