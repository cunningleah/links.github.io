Well, throughout 2009, DoApp has been busy on another front: its Mobile Local News app, which is an ad-supported iPhone app it co-developed with partnerInergize Digital Media of Minneapolis. The latter is also helping DoApp market the app, primarily signing up TV stations initially, which brand the app for their own use in their local market. And each of those branded versions of the app is distributed via the App Storeto consumers, who download them for free. DoApp also has the app available for the Android mobile platform, with Blackberry and Palm Pre versions coming soon. (By the way, DoApps first customer for the iPhone mobile news app was our own WCCO-TV, Channel 4.)
