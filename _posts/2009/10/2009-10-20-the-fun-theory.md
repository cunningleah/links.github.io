In one of my favorite reads this last year,  Play:  How it Shapes the Brain, Opens the Imagination, and Invigorates the Soul,  author Stuart Brown talks about play as “an un-realized power that can transform our social and economic lives.”   


As I read, I realized:   
-  We have replaced play with homework--big mistake
-  Play is how our passions find us
-  Play is where happiness finds us, and
-  Play is where failure isn’t failure and isn’t emotionally charged.  Play is all about iteration and we iterate on the emerging questions that arise from within us and that we are driven to understand.


Some of the most accomplished people I’ve met--Dean Kamen, Roderick MacKinnon, Charles Zuker, and Nathan Myhrvold--talk about their work as play. When I ask them how they played as children, they often describe activities that explore the same questions and ideas they are exploring today in their work. At a gathering of molecular scientists, more than a few whispered that, as children, they'd electrocuted bugs--they had to know what would happen. Interaction, reaction. One of them told me that his MBA sister had a chemistry set that looked as if it had never been used, while his was trashed shortly after he opened it. He tried everything.


Recently, VW launched a campaign, The Fun Theory. The videos on the site show people:  
-  Choosing stairs over an escalator in a subway station when the stairs are turned into piano keys
-  Recycling glass when the glass recycle bin is like a slot machine, and
-  Clearing litter when a trash can offers sound effects as trash is pitched in.


The Fun Theory Award competition is accepting entries until November 15.  Short window, competition opened October 1.  Radar readers are brainy and creative.  A winning combination!
