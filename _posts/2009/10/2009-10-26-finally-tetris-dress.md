Well, it's been a long time coming, but I have FINALLY finished my Tetris dress, and here it is. Here's the back (with iPhoto enhancement -- the colors aren't really that bright): Here's the bodice, so you can see the contrast facing (these colors are truer, too): It's just in time, too, as I'm talking at the Web 2.0 Summit in San Francisco today (about Wordnik, naturally!), and I hate giving a talk without a new dress. There's something about sewing that makes it easier to think out talks ... by the way, the talk will be STREAMED LIVE (ulp) at 3 pm PDT, so if you want to hear me talk, tune in! (Warning: I am shorter in real life than I am on the blog.)If you like this dress, would you do me a favor and tweet/Facebook/delicious the link around? I'm having a personal-best contest to see if this one shows up in more places than the Darth Vader dress!
