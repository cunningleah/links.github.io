Blog search engine Technorati has raised $2 million in new funding from existing investors Draper Fisher Jurvetson, Mobius Venture Capital, and others. The San Francisco company has now raised more than $32 million.

The funding was first reported in TechCrunch, and Technorati has confirmed the news. The company just launched the revamped blog rankings that we wrote about earlier this month.
