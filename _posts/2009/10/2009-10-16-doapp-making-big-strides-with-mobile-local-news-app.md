If you’re a TV news station, newspaper, or online news site, you probably should get to know Minnesota startup DoApp Inc.  For those of you in our local tech community who already know of this firm (it launched early in 2008), you may find this fact amazing: on a search for “DoApp” in the Apple® iTunes® App Store, you’ll see the company now has — count ‘em — no less than 84 apps published, available for download.  Now, you may have known DoApp only for utility and game apps, with which it had early success soon after the App Store launched in mid-2008.  The firm ended 2008 with well over 3 million downloads of those apps — 11 of them are now in the store (and most have been updated multiple times). But what are those other 70-some apps (and counting)?
