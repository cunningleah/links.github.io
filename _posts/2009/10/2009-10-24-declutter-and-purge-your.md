Design weblog Hello Kitchen's kitchen-decluttering checklist provides a quick, easy guide to tackling the large chore of cleaning and decluttering your kitchenhelping you purge what you don't need and keep around your must-haves.
 It's easy to tell when you need to purge a few items from your kitchenthe overflowing drawers will tip you off to that. What's harder is knowing what should stay and what should go.
