Joe Newman of Public Citizen:



  How much of your personal information is Google willing to turn
  over to a third party without a fight? We’ve asked a California
  federal court to unseal a report that would give customers of the
  world’s largest Internet company an answer to that question.
  […] A Gmail user who did nothing wrong had his or her account
  shut down because of the bank’s monumental screw up. And Google,
  a company that basically prints its own cash, didn’t lift a
  finger to protect the rights of one of its users.
