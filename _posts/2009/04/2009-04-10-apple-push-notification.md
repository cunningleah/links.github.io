Apple told developers today that their Push Notification servers were ready for testing.  Those developers whose application hope to operate behind the scenes will need to use this service to notify users of new information.  From Apple:

The Apple Push Notification service provides a way to alert your users of new information, even when your application isn't running. Send text notifications, trigger audible alerts, or add a numbered badge to your application icon.
