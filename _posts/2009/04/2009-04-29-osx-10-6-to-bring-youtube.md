It’s official: YouTube uploading couldn’t be any easier.  Apple has just announced that, in addition to a host of new features, OSX 10.6 (better known as Snow Leopard) will allow YouTube uploading from Quicktime.

Of course, this isn’t Apple’s first endorsement of the YouTube brand.  Apple has previously played nice with the video sharing giant when it came to providing direct access to their content via AppleTV.  Similar arrangements were made in time for the launch of the iPhone.

In addition to the uploading of supported file formats via the new Quicktime, iTunes will begin playing friendlier with your video files as well.  Expect to see fully-functional ways to convert and export videos for use on AppleTV and the iPod.  It may be enough to send Mac-exclusive video converting giant VisualHub to an early grave.

No official word on Snow Leopard’s release yet, but analysts are predicting we’ll see it by the end of summer.
