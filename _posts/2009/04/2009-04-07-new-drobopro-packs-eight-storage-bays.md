Today, Drobo is announcing their newest product, DroboPro.  It basically doubles the amount of drive bays to eight and puts a reasonable $1300 price tag on the setup.  It has the Droboshare networking built-in over iSCSI 1Gb Ethernet.  You can also use Firewire 800 or Hi speed USB.  DroboApps should also work on this setup.  This will hit the sweet spot of many small busineeses and high end home setups.  Well have to get some reviews before were sold on it, however.
