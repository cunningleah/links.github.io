After five interviews and five offers, Max has accepted his first PA position!  All the piles of paperwork and credentialing is signed, and it was mailed off today.  Starting July 6, Max will practice in surgery as part of Surgical Consultants at Fairview Ridges Hospital in Burnsville.  Soon, we'll be able to see his shining smile at http://www.surgicalconsult.com/pages/staff.html.  That's IF he passes his boards on May 11:)  We are very excited for this new phase of life and so proud of everything Max has and will accomplish!
