Birdhouse 1.0 is now available at — err, on — the App Store for $4. It’s a notepad for Twitter by Adam Lisagor and Cameron Hunt. It’s not a full-on Twitter client — it is instead very specifically a Twitter posting client. A fussy, precious concept to be sure, and the result is a wonderfully fussy and precious app.


Even if you’re already not interested in the app itself — if you’re sitting there thinking to yourself, “Man, draft tweets is the dumbest idea I’ve ever heard”, or if you don’t even use Twitter — at least watch the demo/introductory movie, which, I dare say, is the finest example of the form made to date. Note, for example, the reflection of the trees on the iPhone trim during the screencast sections. Think about how much thought went into the app based on how much thought went into this swell little movie.


And if “Sandwich Dynamics” isn’t the best name of a new software company this year, I’ll eat my hat.
