I linked to Robert Spychala’s “Short URL Auto-Discovery” proposal just 10 days ago, but there’s been a lot of discussion and momentum since then, and Spychala has updated his proposal accordingly. I really like where the proposal stands now, recommending this HTML syntax:


<link rel="shorturl" href="http://short.com/1234" />


and this HTTP header:


Link: <http://short.com/1234>; rel=shorturl
