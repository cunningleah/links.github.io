Modeled after Toronto’s popular Rails Pub Night, iPhone Pub Night is a meetup of iPhone hackers and would-be hackers at — as the name suggests — a pub.

It’s like the after-meeting drinks that many people enjoy at Ruby.mn, MinneDemo, etc. without the pre-drinks formalities.  




When:
Monday, March 23 starting @ 7pm


Where:
Uptown Bar


Address:
3018 Hennepin Ave S, Minneapolis, MN 55408



We’ll have the room they usually reserve for concerts.  The layout is amenable to sitting and eating and also mingling, so it should be a good fit.

They’re expecting us; it’d be nice to give them an approximation of how many to expect.  If you’re planning on coming, do me a favor and write me so I can keep a tally.
