We talked this week about the 500 GB sweet spot in laptop hard drives.  Another good option has popped up.  J&R just marked down the Western Digital 500GB USB External WDME5000TN (Midnight Black) hard drive to $104.99(+$6 Shipping).   This is in retail box and is $45 off of list price and less than we could find anywhere else (J&R through Buy.com has it for the same price with more for shipping and tax).  Other colors are also available at higher prices.
