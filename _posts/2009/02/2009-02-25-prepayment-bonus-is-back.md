Last fall we eliminated the prepayment bonus when we lowered prices on bigger slices. Since then, theres been a steady stream of pleas in our suggestion box to reinstate it. Ask and ye shall receive  the bonus is back in effect! To get it, make a payment that is the greater of 6x your current monthly bill or $240.



Examples:



Monthly bill: $20  a payment of $240 or more to get the 10% bonus



Monthly bill: $70  a payment of $420 or more to get the 10% bonus



We hope this helps people making annual payments on a business credit card or those of you managing your own customer projects on Slicehost. Enjoy!
