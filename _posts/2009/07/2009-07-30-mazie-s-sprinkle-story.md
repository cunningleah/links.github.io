As part of my niece's birthday present, I invited her over for a Sprinkle Sleepover where I took tons of photos and promised I would put together a book about the evening, narrated by her.  We SPRINKLED homemade pizza with seasoning, baked and decorated triple chocolate cupcakes with SPRINKLES and ran through the SPRINKLER in the backyard.  At the end of the evening, Mazie dictated to me what the book should say.  Sprinkle Sleepover, a story by Mazie, is now complete.  And here are my top three lines--direct from the mouth of a four-year-old:)I'm going to tell you something that is pretty goofy, ok?  Mom and I are having a power cut and the bathroom light is not working just like the heat.  I learned this from Peppa Pig.Louie ate the cupcakes and he's gonna throw up and Rusty maybe, too.  Mom picked me up in the middle of the night.  Rusty said, "What did you do?" and mom said, "Put the sickness in the garbage." I'm gonna tell you something that I think you've never heard.  Angie, the things are all gonna be in the book.  I'm going to whisper it really quiet, "With pants in the light at the end."
