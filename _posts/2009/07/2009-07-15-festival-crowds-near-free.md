The Winnipeg Folk Festival wrapped up Sunday with a homecoming for Loreena McKennitt.
The Celtic New Age star returned to her home province, and the festival, which she last played in 1992, to conclude the musical portion of the 36th annual festival, which set a new record with a preliminary cumulative total of 73,000 people who visited the site over the expanded five-day event that began Wednesday. Of that total, 55,000 of those paid for their tickets, with the rest including volunteers, staff, guests, VIPs and sponsors.
