Today we're excited to release basic Twitter integration in Highrise.


Highrise is the best way to keep track of who you talked to, what was said, and what to do next. Twitter integration allows you to have an even better view of what's on a person's mind, what they're saying right now, and what their current interests are.


This is especially handy if you check a person's Highrise page before contacting them again. Now you can check your previous communications history as well as what they are tweeting right now. Tweets are great conversation starters that show you're paying attention to what's going on in their world.


Here's a video to show you how easy it is to add Twitter info for a contact:





We really hope you like this feature! Thanks again for using Highrise!
