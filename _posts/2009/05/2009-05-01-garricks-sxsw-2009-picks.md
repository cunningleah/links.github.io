5 Stars


Cable TV by Fol Chen
Poppy beats and seductive vocals about doing absolutely nothing. Except watching cable tv. An prime example of the oft overlooked SlackerRock genre.
Nothing At All by Madi Diaz
Like chasing a butterflies through a field on a summer day.

Winona by Totally Michael
A love song to Winona Ryder as sung to ‘Video Killed the Radio Star’.


4 Stars


Up And Down by The Chesterfield Kings
A classic blues rock tune, recalls Lynyrd Skynard.

Tall Green Grass by Cory Branan
Great for that picnic you have after you’re done chasing butterflies.

14 Arms by Crash Kings
An screamy, energizing track - perfect for getting the blood flowing on a dreary day.

FLEX by Doomtree
It’s Doomtree. I like Doomtree.

Crown of Age by The Ettes
I dig the sound of female-fronted punk groups, this one reminds me of Joan Jett.

How We Exit by Gentleman Reg
Despite the horns and non-vocoder vocals, I get a poppy, electronica vibe from this.

Strictly Game by Harlem Shakes
Made the list for the motivating, timely line: “This will be a better year”.

Gettin’ High for Jesus by Holly Golightly and the Brokeoffs
Jug-band!

If You Should Ever Fall On Hard Times by The Iguanas
Harmonica!

Dag by In Stereo (perCeptie & Kapabel)
Dorky Dutch hip hop, in the vein of Die Fantastischen Vier-esque

Steel On Steel by J. Tillman
A big, heavy, melancholy blanket.

Bank Song by The Johnstones
A celebration, though I get the sneaking suspicion it’s about something less than pleasant.

My Derlirium by Ladyhawke
A highly danceable, electronica track, produced by Blondie.

Zero Machine by Le Castle Vania
A Depeche Mode + Smashing Pumpkins mash-up, without the mash-up.

Wake the Sun by The Matches
Play this the next time you’re walking home after singing karaoke “The Sun’ll Come Out Tomorrow” into the wee hours.

Honey, Let Me Sing You A Song  by Matt Hires
I’m guessing Matt Hires opens for Jack Johnson, or enjoys causing “mix-ups”.

Cannibal Queen by Miniature Tigers
Dorky, bouncy, pop - like Tullycraft. “I’m coming for your heart like a cannibal” wins for best song lyric of SXSW 2009.

Down in Electric by Operahouse
Another excellent example of oft-overlooked Spy rock genre.

Little Brass Bear by Rachel Goodrich
This song will get you dancing, the kinda feeling badly toward the signer, and then…kazoos!

Offbeat Feeling by The Resignators
Ska. Just the way I like it; big horns, mostly angry lead vocalist, well-dressed men jumping straight up and down - but only a few inches.

You look at me by Rokhsan
A poppy, love song that consistently gives me a big, corny smile.

Bad Choices by Shout Out Out Out Out
I’d like to nominate this song for 2008 Financial Crisis Theme Song. It even sounds like a storms rolling in.

Behind Me Now by The Silos
Conversely, this one’s good for 2009.

Hologram by Ten Out of Tenn
If there’s a remake of Lost in Translation as stop-motion animation, this is on the soundtrack.

Bag Of Hammers by Thao With The Get Down Stay Down
An un-break-up song with a bag of hammers is being used as a threat. It’s a nervous, nervous smile.

I’ll Play What You Want by Toy Horses
If Stiff Little Fingers were poppier and happier..but not as poppy and happy as Squeeze.

Idunno by Ungdomskulen
You know I how much I dig electronically, distorted vocals.

Trains I Missed by Walt Wilkins
The stereotypical country song version of, ‘when god closes a door he opens a window’.

Birds of a Feather by We Were Lovers
Sugary Sweet Vocal is protected her older brother, Bass Guitar.

Amateur by The 757s
Another un-break-up song. This time from the guys side.


3 Stars


On My Kees by Aqualung
Don’t let him back, don’t let let him back. So, did you let him back?

Caroline by The Belleville Outfit
An fun, fun track invoking the post-Swing vibe (a la Squirrel Nut Zippers)

You Won’t Be Able To Be Sad by The Break And Repair Method
The opening song to the next John Hughes teen production.

Imitation of the Sky by Bryan Scary and The Shredding Tears
Sounds like all of Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Heart’s Club wrapped into a single song.

Still Have My Heart by Caitlin Crosby
She’s either in love with an imaginary person or she’s a stalker.

Hail Destroyer by Cancer Bats
After years of listening through SXSW Showcasing Artists, I finally found a Scandanavian Canadian death metal track I enjoy.

A little wiser now by Choo Choo
I generally dig songs that happily admit historical stupidity.

9999 (Ways To Hate Us) by The Clutters
It’s fantastic that a group of nasal-signers found each other and started a band.

R.I.M.L. by Codebreaker
This song might be a joke. Like an SNL skit. I’m not hip enough to know.

Will I Stay by Colin Munroe
Colin’s pretty whiny. Thankfully the band drops such big beats it can be over looked.

Kamikaze rock’n'roll by Dead Sexy Inc
British Invasion rock + harmonicas.

I’m Not Crying. You’re Not Crying, are you? by Dear and the Headlights
A leisurely stroll through the woods…until you step in a beehive.

Capture and Develop by The Details
Just under 3 minutes of longing guilt.

That Sinking Feeling by Emma Lee
The chorus completely melts me.

Boom! Boom! Boom! by The Everyday Visuals
Wins for best use of the title within the song.

DARTS by FLiP
It’s in Japanese - except for the English chorus. And yes, that just confuses me more.

Bugguts by Gavin Castleton
Reminds me of the teen car accident pop songs from the 1950’s.

Goes Cube Song 57 by Goes Cube
A good, guitar-driven, grunge tune - like a Soundgarden or early Foo Fighters.

C.Y.O.A. by HEARTSREVOLUTION
Female Japanese vocalist + distorting vocoder = delicious noise

Walk Through Fire by Indian Jewelry
There might be instruments and vocals in there. Somewhere deep below the sea of distortion.

Single Fins & Safety Pins by The Japanese Motors
A catchy, fun-lovin’ beach tune.

Happy Birthday You by Jay Jay Pistolet
Remember Marilyn Monroe’s signing of ‘Happy Birthday’? This is opposite of that.

Over You by Jay Nash
A sincerely sweet Country tune featuring Jim Croce’s guitar,

Gloom Doom Buttercups by Kittens Ablaze
I’m not confident everyone in the band is playing the same song…and that’s why I dig it.

Sushi by Kyle Andrews
A synth-pop tune reminding me of all my favorite Top 40 songs from the 1980s.

Posidonia by La Habitacion Roja
This could be a stereotypical Latin pop tune. It still holds up to heavy rotation.

No Generation by Lions
Like White Zombie or RAGTM without the annoying parts.

Punch and Judy by Little Thief
Solid, simple drum, guitar, and vocal work.

Lalita by The Love Language
Your favorite fleece jacket - as a song.

days in universe by Maren Parusel
Maren Parusel could be singing directions from Google Maps and I’d be enthralled.

Diseases Of Yore by MC Frontalot
If you can’t learn medical history from geekcore rap - what good is it? And I think Jonathan Coulton opens the track.

Don’t Be On With Her by Miami Horror
Another delicious synth-pop 80s track.

Bus Stop Lovers by My Federation
A great track for you run mix - especially if you use public transit signs as landmarks.

Cuando, Cuando by Nina Dioz
Extra-tough Latin rap. I don’t know Spanish but I think she’s saying something about using my head as a pinata.

Greyhound Bus by Oh Susanna
There’s a stereotypical Country song about a man with a broken down truck and a runaway dog. This might that stereotypical song for women.

Call and Response by Or, the Whale
A couple years back there were a bunch of songs at SXSW about losing New Orleans. This one is about rebuilding the city.

Broken Heart Land by Owen Temple
Made the list immediate after I hear the opening line: “How did your past get stuck in a pawn shop?”

123 Stop by The Postelles
The Monkees with dirty guitars.

The Waves by Princeton
Maracas and disillusionment.

I Couldn’t Make It by Randy Weeks
Lou Reed, post-Velvet Underground, and a little bit Country.

Ornamental by Scissors for Lefty
British people get so excited sometimes.

King Bolo by Scram C Baby
King Missile-esque storytelling with better instrument work.

she creatures invade by The She Creatures
When GWAR finally makes that movie, the sequel will star The She Creatures.

Slow Club by Slow Club
A great example of a SlackerRock duets.

Hit the Wall by Song Island Revue
“I hit the wall… / I painted a road on it” is much more poetic than that tired phrase about lemons and lemonade.

You say GOOD BYE by SpecialThanks
Japan does American female-led rock really well.

Grass is Green by Sweet Water
I think in the 90s, this band was called, The Fall.

Pacemaker by Teenage Bottlerocket
Can’t be the Ramones, the track is a full 2:30 minutes long,

This Mission by This Is My Condition
A Discord Records-esque D.C. Hardcore-style track by way of Lawrence, KS.

It’s Not Too Late by Triple Cobra
The soundtrack to “That Thing You Do” if it was about a Goth band.

In The City by Tunnel Clones
Digable Planets-style hip hop.

Get On With It by Val Emmich
You heard the man.

Drown Them Out by Viva Voce
Sirens. Calling me into the rocks.

This Is Our Perfect Crime  by The Von Bondies
The 21st Century version of Skid Row’s ‘Youth Gone Wild’.

I Go I Go I Go by Wave Machines
Comparisons can be made between this song and REM’s ‘Shiny Happy People’. Parts of them would be right.

Safety In Numbers by The Wax Museums
Punk kids discussing recruitment tactics.

Let Me Drive by Winter Gloves
Last year I was big on clapping, I think that’s why I included this one.

Death or Radio by Zolof the Rock & Roll Destroyer
“Let’s hold hands and listen to shitty bands…” - is exactly how I imagine SXSW.

Soft The Hard Way by 18th Dye
The chorus keeps getting stuck in my head and caught by the spam filter.
