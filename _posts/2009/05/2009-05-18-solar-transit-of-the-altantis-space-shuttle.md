This an amazing photo of the solar transit of the space shuttle Atlantis, made by Thierry Legault on May 12th. The duration of the transit was only 0.3 seconds and the shuttle was in orbit at a height of 260 km. You can see another photo of the solar transit of the Atlantis and Hubble telescope together here.
