Even though I'm almost exclusively shooting Nikon these days, I'm still watching developments in Canon land. Today's announcement of a firmware update that adds manual exposure control for shooting video with the 5D Mark II is a great one to see. 


Long-time readers will know that I think that Canon short-shrifted the 5D Mark II in more than a few ways. There's a great sensor in there, but the control set should have been better. And the video mode is astounding, but the auto-exposure mode was baffling to say the least. I'd go so far as to call it a flaw. I've talked to several people using it for video that really love it except for the fact that they can't control exposure. Having the exposure bounce around in variable light conditions isn't what you want most of the time. This update should fix that nicely for those that want to shoot in full-up manual mode.


Announcements on Rob Gailbraith DPI, PDN, and DPReview. Looks like the firmware will be out in June.
