I announced the beta for Mobile Orchard’s Beginning iPhone Workshop late in the evening one weeknight last month before going to bed. By the time I work up the next morning more than half the spots were spoken for, and by noon the class had sold out. People who hadn’t checked Twitter or their feed reader until lunchtime were out of luck and, much as I hated it, I had to turn people away.

The beta class — and its 75% discount — were a one time event. Furthermore, at $1200 our class already priced at the low end of the market.  However, I wanted to find a way to offer a discounted non-beta version of the class to those would-be attendees because the bulk of them were fellow hackers, would-be iPhone entrepreneurs and small-shop developers. In short, they’re people I identify with.

I mentioned this conundrum to Luke Francl, who provided a hotel-and-airfare inspired pricing solution derived from the book The Economic Naturalist by Robert H. Frank:

Hotels and airlines provide deep discounts when the itineraries include a Saturday stay. Business travelers aren’t price-sensitive but are schedule-sensitive. They don’t shell out their own money, and when the dealing’s done they want to high-tail it back to their families. Leisure travelers, by comparison, are price-sensitive but schedule-flexible: they go out of their own pockets for travel expense and tend to include a weekend in their plans to maximize their fun-time.

So, I decided to try something similar and offer a “community edition” of the class:  at $599 it’s priced at less than half the normal cost and it’s open to anyone but, because it’s given over the weekend, it’ll likely be more attractive to fellow hackers, would-be entrepreneurs and small-shop developers than to folks who need to learn iPhone development for a large employer. Same offering, different days, discounted price.
