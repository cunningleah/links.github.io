First thing here is the fact that Pinboard bought Delicious for $35,000. According to Crunchbase Delicious had Amazon, Marc Andreessen, Tim O'Reilly, Union Square Ventures, Esther Dyson and other investors in various rounds. Second, connecting with some extremely passionate and enthusiastic users (fandom in this case) and evolving your road map with them is a proven path.
