I’m a big fan of Let's Encrypt and I’m very happy to see it being adopted as widely as it has been. Amazing success story and what a great mission. Let's Encrypt is a major milestone to a completely encrypted web. Also worth reading the [EFF writeup on this milestone](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/06/lets-encrypt-has-issued-100-million-certificates).
