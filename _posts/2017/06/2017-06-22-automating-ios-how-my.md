[Viticci](https://twitter.com/viticci) shares how he's using [Pythonista](http://omz-software.com/pythonista/) in iOS to extend his workflows into new areas. Viticci is the one that illustrated use cases for [Workflow](https://workflow.is) that really opened my eyes to what I can do. I know how to write Python, but I haven't extended any workflows into Pythonista, yet. ðŸ¤”
