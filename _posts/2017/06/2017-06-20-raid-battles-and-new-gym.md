I ignored Pokémon GO for a long time but my son was really into it. He wanted to progress levels and battle in gyms. I started helping him and then *I started getting into It!* It's fun to see Niantic doing a *massive* rethink of a such a critical part of the game. The changes will be welcome though as gym battles are ridiculously hard for new players coming into the game.
