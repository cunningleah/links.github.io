I think a lot about digital tracking and privacy online. It worries me greatly as one of the least appreciated aspects of so much activity online. People shrug this off as not important but nearly everyone does that with no appreciation of the issue or how deep the surveillance goes. I haven't read this whole report, but it’s on my list to read in it’s entirety. I think I’m going to start using the word surveillance instead of tracking. It’s more accurate.
