I cut the cord on cable TV several years ago. It’s not surprising that the Netflix subscriber count has grown and surpassed. The surprising part to me is that cable TV numbers are not dropping faster. I wonder how many of those are effectively no cost subscriptions bundled with Internet service. The last time we signed an agreement with Comcast they charged $10 *more* a month to *not* have cable TV!
