This is a terrible headline for this article. The article is about maintaining technical proficiency which I agree completely with. If as a CTO you are taking sprint points in your deliverables? I think your doing it wrong. You do need to be super connected to the work and the technology though. You do that by continuing to embrace your craft in many ways.
