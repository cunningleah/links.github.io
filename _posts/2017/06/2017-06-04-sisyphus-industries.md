I got to see these tables in action at the Maker Faire and I was blown away. They use sand like a Zen Garden toy under glass and then control a marble magnetically with an Arduino device. It uses the marble to slowly create these amazing patterns in the sand. Mesmerizing! Felt similar to when you gaze into a fire. Amazingly successful Kickstarter too raising $2 million!
