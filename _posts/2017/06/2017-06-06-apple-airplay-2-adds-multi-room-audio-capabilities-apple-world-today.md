I use AirPlay a lot. That is the primary way I listen to music at home. All of my "zones" are AirPlay capable. Only being able to send to multiple AirPlay locations from a Mac is a definite limit for me. Sending to multiple from iOS will be nice, but it’s also not clear to me that old AirPort Express units will be able to deal with AirPlay 2. Hmm… let's hope there is a firmware upgrade to get them AirPlay 2.
