I didn’t realize these charts were named Waffle Charts. I dislike pie charts greatly, but do find that these waffle charts show certain data sets in a very useful way. They also provide immediate visibility better than a pie chart does. Makes me chuckle that this article has 'But, What Would [Edward Tufte](https://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/) Do?' section.
