This is a start, but I think we need to go further. [Code: And Other Laws of Cyberspace](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0465039146/?tag=thingelstad01-20) by [Larry Lessing](http://www.lessig.org/about/) makes this point in a big way. If technologists are creating the worlds in which we interact, the structure of those worlds is important in more ways than we know. **Ethics** is completely missing in this discussion inside our industry.
