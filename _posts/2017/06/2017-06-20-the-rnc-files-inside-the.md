This is an amazing writeup on a huge breach of **198 million** Americans data. The part that blew me away in this is the listing of the CSV column names. It illustrates very well the data that was exposed for everyone. It also should prompt thoughts on how all that data was collected. The level of specificity in these data sets is amazing, and to me at least, very frightening.
