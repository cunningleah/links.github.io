Everything about this is so awesome. The name, the logo (pacifier!) and the entire concept. A social network filled with completely inane bot activity. Your actions are reinforced by likes from bots. I can’t figure out how cynical this is, but it’s a perfect on-ramp to dozens of dystopian sci-fi novels.
