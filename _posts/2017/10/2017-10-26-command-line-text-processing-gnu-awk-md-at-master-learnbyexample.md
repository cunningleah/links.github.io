I recently had to go through a hundred or so markdown files with [YAML](http://yaml.org) front matter for [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) and modify the [front matter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/) with data from the filename. I did 3 or 4 by hand and realized how much that was going to be terrible. Then I wrote a for loop in a bash script with awk and sed and I was done in a couple minutes. This writeup of awk is very nice and the examples are rich. I'd recommend reading the similar one for [sed](https://github.com/learnbyexample/Command-line-text-processing/blob/master/gnu_sed.md)
