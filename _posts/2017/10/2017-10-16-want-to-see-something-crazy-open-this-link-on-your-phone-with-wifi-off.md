It seems like everyone is selling any and all data they collect on us. 

> But what these services show us is even more alarming: US telcos appear to be selling direct, non-anonymized, real-time access to consumer telephone data to third party services — not just federal law enforcement officials — who are then selling access to that data.

I thought FCC regulations didn’t allow telecom companies to do this, but clearly that isn’t the case. Regulation is needed here. Sadly I don’t expect it to happen since the money and politics are all on the other side of the argument.
