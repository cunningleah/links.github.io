[Aaron Parecki](https://aaronparecki.com) released the iOS app that he uses to record his location and use on his website. If you love location tracking but what to own your data this is a cool option. This is only the client though, you have to have a server to send the events to. It would be perfectly paired with a cloud-based serverless API to receive these events, record them and serve them up to other services. Someone want to make that?
