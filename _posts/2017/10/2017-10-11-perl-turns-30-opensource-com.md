I like to give Perl code a hard time because so much of it is so sloppy. However, truth be told some of the very first coding I did on the web was all Perl [CGI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Gateway_Interface) code doing really goofy things on the web. The block of Perl that I wrote for BigCharts was some of my favorite. It’s amazing that Perl is now 30 years old. These days I definitely prefer Python but Perl does deserve some respect at least for it’s regular expression capabilities.
