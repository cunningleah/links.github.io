It is fun to see experimentation in new web browsers and what they include by default. [Brave](https://www.brave.com) for example chooses to block trackers and ads by default. I like the idea of dimming tabs not in use (although I practice good tab hygiene). This browser also deals with low bandwidth situations directly. In some ways this reminds me of a modern day [lynx](http://lynx.invisible-island.net) browser, which Iâ€™m shocked to see is still in development.
