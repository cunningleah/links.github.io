I played D&D when I was a kid, the original version of the game. I was a bit young though and only knew a couple other kids who were into it again. I played again in college and had many long, long evenings with campaigns. I always play a Wizard. Usually good.

> Then, a fifth edition of D. & D. rules came out, in 2014, and, somehow, the culture was receptive again to bags of holding and silver-haired drow. People started buying up these volumes in droves. “More people are interested in D&D than we thought,” the game’s lead developer, Mike Mearls, said, as print runs repeatedly sold out. “Who are these people? What do they want?”
