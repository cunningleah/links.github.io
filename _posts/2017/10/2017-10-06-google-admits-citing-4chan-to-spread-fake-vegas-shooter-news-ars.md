Google News picked up completely fake content and promoted it shortly after the mass shooting in Las Vegas. The answer suggested is further tuning of algorithms. I've worked in the news industry in the past and the answer is even easier â€” **hire some editors!** Also covered in [NY Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/02/business/las-vegas-shooting-fake-news.html?_r=0&referer=) and [The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/10/google-and-facebook-have-failed-us/541794/).
