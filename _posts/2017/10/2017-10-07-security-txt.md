This seems like a good idea. I don't know that anyone would ever need to notify me, but I went ahead and created a [security.txt](https://links.thingelstad.com/security.txt) anyway. It complements my [robots.txt](https://links.thingelstad.com/robots.txt) and [humans.txt](https://links.thingelstad.com/humans.txt).
