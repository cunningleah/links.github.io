Levy's review of the iPhone X affirms my decision to pause. The number one thing I’m skeptical about is the overall speed and performance of FaceID. I love how quick and nearly "without thought" TouchID is. I’m sure FaceID will get there, but he highlights that it takes a moment and sometimes doesn't get it right. Similar to 1st generation TouchID. Getting rid of the home button entirely doesn't worry me at all.
