I've been a [Feedbin](https://feedbin.com) user for years now and highly recommend them. One of the best $30 a year I spend. If you have never experienced using a feed reader I would highly recommend giving it a try. This post doesn't highlight it but I also liked that [Feedbin added JSON Feed support](https://feedbin.com/blog/2017/05/22/feedbin-supports-json-feed/) right away.
