I do a terrible job at having a deliberate beginning to my day. Before I get up I’m caught up on email and have usually also checked in on RSS feeds and such. I find a lot of the thinking on how to structure a morning routine interesting, but I haven't successfully adopted it yet. I think it’s important to answer "for what goal?" in this process.
