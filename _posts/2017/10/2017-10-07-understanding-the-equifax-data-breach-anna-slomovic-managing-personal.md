Enlightening post from the former Chief Privacy Officer of Equifax, [Anna Slomovic](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anna-slomovic-a8374014/), on the Equifax data breach.

> Equifaxâ€™s sputtering response did not surprise me, and neither did the reactions in the press, the Congress, or the consumer protection agencies. Unfortunately, most of the proposed solutions do not address the fundamental issue: to credit reporting agencies, consumers are not a product, they are a cost. To understand this, you need to know something about credit reporting.

How many places hold your data and do not think of you as their customer? This is why we need regulation and laws for this data.
