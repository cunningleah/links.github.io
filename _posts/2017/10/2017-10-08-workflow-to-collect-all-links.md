This is a great example of the power of [Workflow](https://workflow.is). I have a number of workflows like this and they are surprisingly easy to do on iOS, and really not easy to do on any other platform. I have several workflows that increase my efficiency significantly. I find inspiration in seeing what other people do with this powerful tool.
