Interesting tech to power reasoning systems. This excerpt caught my eye:

> RDF & OWL are for semantic web (not databases) and logicians (not software engineers). And GRAKN.AI, as you may expect, is for databases and software engineers.

I’ve read a bit about [RDF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RDFa) and [OWL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Ontology_Language) and agree it’s hard for an engineer to grok. This article is vendor-written to support [GRAKN.AI](https://grakn.ai/) but still an interesting read.
