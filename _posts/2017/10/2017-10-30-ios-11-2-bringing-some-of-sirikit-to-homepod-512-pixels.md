This is interesting news to me. My biggest gap in capability with devices like the Echo are the fact that they don't identify the different people in the house (which can be done based on voice signature, like Siri does today) and it has no access to iCloud and the Apple ecosystem. If HomePod recognizes the speaker by voice and then can access that persons iCloud information that would be amazing.
