I am an extensive user of my contacts system so this macOS app appealed to me right away. I already have quick access to my contacts from [LaunchBar](https://obdev.at/products/launchbar/index.html) but Cardhop offers the ability to add and edit information in the same place with a more optimized user experience. I purchased this and so far it looks very good.
