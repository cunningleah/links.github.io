Netlify shares how they moved from [Lunr.js](https://lunrjs.com) search using JavaScript to [Algolia](https://twitter.com/anna_picchetti) using their hosted service and JavaScript library. I used Lunr.js to put search in Link Thing but searching 8,000+ documents is far too much for a client-side search solution.
