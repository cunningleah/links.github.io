I hadn't heard of [Bitmark](https://bitmark.com) but it’s an interesting use of a blockchain for a non-currency use case.

> Most people are familiar with blockchains through Bitcoin. Bitcoin uses the blockchain as a public ledger to prevent double-spending of the same virtual coin. This same public ledger can be applied to physical hardware products through a bitmark. Products that have been bitmarked can have their provenance tracked back to the factory using the public ledger, thus hampering cloning and warranty fraud – the physical equivalent of double-spending a Bitcoin.

This seems like a good solution to this problem.
