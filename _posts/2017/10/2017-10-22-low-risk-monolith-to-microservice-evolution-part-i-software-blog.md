Excellent writeup on approaching a large-scale monolithic application and beginning to decompose it. I've seen these approaches used first-hand and they work. However, it takes a lot of time. The time probably goes up more than linear as size of the monolith goes up. Check out [part 2](http://blog.christianposta.com/microservices/low-risk-monolith-to-microservice-evolution-part-ii/) of the article as well.
