In general I find the research that people can do on Wikipedia to be amazing and this article is no exception. This is worth looking at just for the great graphs.

> We have managed to detect dynamical patterns in terms of events and collective memories in Wikipedia using the combination of the hyperlinks graph and the visitor activity on the website.

There is a lot of focus on using machine learning and algorithms to filter news for events and those algorithms have been easily tricked and manipulated. I wonder if something closer to what researches have been doing with Wikipedia data may be a better solution to that problem.
