Highlighting how [Sephora](https://www.sephora.com) has defied technology trends regarding gender diversity in technology. This reference to EEOC data is sobering:

> Women hold 23% of roles in the technical ranks at the top 75 Silicon Valley companies, according to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. A report from the commission attributes the scarcity of women in those roles to inhospitable work cultures, isolation, a “firefighting” work style, long hours and a lack of advancement.

Take a look at the 'Industry Pipeline' graphs and note that the only industries with lower representation of women than tech is ‘automative and industrial manufacturing’ and ‘energy and basic materials’. There is a lot of room to improve! Thanks [@anna_picchetti](https://twitter.com/anna_picchetti) for the link!
