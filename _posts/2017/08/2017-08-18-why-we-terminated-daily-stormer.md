Tough decision from the CEO of CloudFlare. Hosting providers always retain the legal right to take actions like this, but they rarely do. As you remind this remember that WikiLeaks was also denied service from companies like Visa and PayPal. This isn't a right or left thing, but instead about how do companies that provide broad services treat organizations that are on the absolute fringes of society or legality. The directness of Matt Prince in taking this action is admirable.
