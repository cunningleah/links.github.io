Interesting brief read on impact of pronoun choice! I am deliberate in my use of pronouns. I would never use the objective 3rd person but I do always make sure to use "we" when talking about the successes of the team and milestones achieved. As a leader I also tend to use "I", first person, when referring to failures.
