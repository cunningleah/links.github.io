I have [TextTool 2](http://blackfoginteractive.com/texttool/index.html) in my automation stack on iOS. It has super powerful features. Unfortunately the day after this great writeup [the developer announced he is ceasing development on it](https://www.macsparky.com/blog/2017/8/the-demise-of-texttool-2). He disclosed his total sales revenue for TextTool 2 was **a little over $3,100**. When you hear stories about getting rich on mobile apps remember that this is much more common.
