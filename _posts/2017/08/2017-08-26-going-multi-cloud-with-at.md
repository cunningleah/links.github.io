Comprehensive writeup comparing and contrasting AWS and Google Cloud. I love the opener on growing infrastructure in a single cloud region "like inflating a balloon in a porcupine farm". Worthwhile read! It would surprise non-technical people that billing is such a challenge but I can share first hand that itâ€™s massively complicated.
