I really enjoy [MacSparky](https://www.macsparky.com/)'s [home screen series](https://www.macsparky.com/?tag=home+screens#show-archive). I tend to always find some new app or new way of thinking about things. [Sal Soghoian](https://macosxautomation.com) is notable as the author of AppleScript so I took particular note on this one. I also love how he considers the privacy angle of his smart phone.
