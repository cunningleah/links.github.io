My interest was piqued on this recent release of Swarm (from what we used to think of as Foursquare) because a number of IndieWeb people I follow use it. That surprises me since this seems like a privacy nightmare, but the app has evolved to be less social and more private/journal focused. I would however give the Terms and Service and Privacy Policy a detailed read before I did anything with this. I would assume they are selling all your movement and location data to any number of ad networks.
