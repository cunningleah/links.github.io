Overall, our results showed that, while real-world social networks were positively associated with overall well-being, the use of Facebook was negatively associated with overall well-being. These results were particularly strong for mental health; most measures of Facebook use in one year predicted a decrease in mental health in a later year. We found consistently that both liking othersâ€™ content and clicking links significantly predicted a subsequent reduction in self-reported physical health, mental health, and life satisfaction.
