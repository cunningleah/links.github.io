The Intercultural Development Inventory (IDI) assesses intercultural competence—the capability to shift cultural perspective and appropriately adapt behavior to cultural differences and commonalities. Intercultural competence has been identified as a critical capability in a number of studies focusing on overseas effectiveness of international sojourners, international business adaptation and job performance, international student adjustment, international transfer of technology and information, international study abroad and inter-ethnic relations within nations. The Intercultural Development Inventory is a 50-item questionnaire, available online that can be completed in 15–20 minutes.
