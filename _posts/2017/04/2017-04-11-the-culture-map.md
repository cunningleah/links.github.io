Based on Erin Meyerâ€™s book The Culture Map, this tool allows you to click on whichever countries you are working with and receive a cultural mapping of the selected cultures. With this tool you can compare how two (or more) cultures build trust, give negative feedback, and make decisions. Which of the selected cultures is the most hierarchical? Which is the most punctual? Which is more forceful in expressing disagreement? This tool provides the answers.
