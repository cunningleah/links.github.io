One piece of advice that has worked for me is using the Pomodoro Technique. It first hit me because of the name (I'm the only person in my house that loves tomatoes, so what?) and when I delved further into it, I realised it could answer a lot of my problems. I had difficulty maintaining levels of focus and the Pomodoro Technique helps with this weakness.
