That’s our bet, our best guess, our belief, our hypothesis. All of those are uncomfortable words for people who believe they’re building the right thing. But, the truth is, we’re always making a bet that we’ll get value. Embedded in that bet are lots of assumptions, risks, and maybe some questions. To focus our learning, we’ll choose the assumption, risk, or question that scares us the most and identify an experiment or method to learn. Then do it. Then use what we’ve learned to change all those going-in beliefs about problems and solutions.
