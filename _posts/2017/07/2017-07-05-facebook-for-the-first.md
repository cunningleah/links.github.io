This seems so obvious. And to be clear, this isn't partisan as influence was peddled in all ways. Facebook was designed, and generates tremendous revenue, by selling you advertisements. It dresses up as a place for friends and a *commons* for people to connect and have dialog. That's all a side-show to sell you. **You are their product.** So, should it be remotely surprising that they can also sell political ideas? We now have 2 billion people on a platform whose purpose is to influence there thinking. Seems *dangerous*. Happy to **not** be a Facebook user.
