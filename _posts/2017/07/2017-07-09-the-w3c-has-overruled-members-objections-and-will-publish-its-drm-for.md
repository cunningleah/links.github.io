A few years ago it felt like our industry had pushed DRM back a bit and it was receding. In music DRM was all but gone after Apple forced the industry there. Now with the move to streaming music everything is DRM blocked again. The role of the W3C with DRM is a sticky one, but this doesn't look very good.
