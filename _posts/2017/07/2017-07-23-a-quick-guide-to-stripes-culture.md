Technology firms have taken great effort to be very specific in thinking about their culture. I do this as well and think it is critical to organizations. As a result, the culture statements are often more verbose than you may think. This one from Stripe is interesting both for it’s verbosity as well as the 'Questions you should ask yourself' sections. Interesting content, I’m not sure about all of it but I like that they have a defined way to share feedback and it’s open to the public.
