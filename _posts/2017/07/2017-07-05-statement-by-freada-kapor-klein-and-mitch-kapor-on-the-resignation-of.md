*The events of 2017 in the tech ecosystem depict a sector gone deeply awry.  This is not just a case of a few bad actors.  This is not something that is fixable with a pledge or a new policy. This is a culture that has been allowed to fester and to rot by enablers who refused to intervene when they witnessed inexcusable behavior or went to great lengths to avoid seeing it.* Wow! Accurate and direct. This is the kind of example and leadership we need in tech.
