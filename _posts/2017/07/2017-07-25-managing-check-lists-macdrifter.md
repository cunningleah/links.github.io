Overview of a lot of different ways to manage lists, specifically focused on what the author is looking for. Useful overview of a bunch of different list managers. It seems like [OmniFocus](https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus) with a project template solution would meet the requirements but that isn't listed in his solutions.
