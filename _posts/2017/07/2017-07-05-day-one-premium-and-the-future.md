I signed up for Day One Premium and was happy to do it. This article on the challenges developers face when moving to a subscription offering is very much on point. I do think there is a challenge in subscription offerings for a *casual* users. I have no issue with apps I use daily but the less frequently used apps are hard to justify. It would be nice to support both models, but that introduces a lot of problems. Will be curious to see how this evolves.
