I recently read [Stuff Matters: Exploring the Marvelous Materials That Shape Our Man-Made World](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0544483944/?tag=thingelstad01-20) and the chapter on concrete was fascinating. The author explores the area of "self healing" concrete that can fix exposure to water. Amazing concept that this article just barely touches on.
