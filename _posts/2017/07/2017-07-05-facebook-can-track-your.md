Assume Facebook knows every website you ever go to and has a massive profile of you. Facebook knows more about you than any other organization in the world. If you don't want that you have to use tools to block it. [Little Snitch](https://www.obdev.at/products/littlesnitch/index.html) can be used to make sure your computer isn't allowed to make network connections to Facebook. I also use [1Blocker](https://1blocker.com) with a custom rule that stops my web browser from talking to any Facebook domains.
