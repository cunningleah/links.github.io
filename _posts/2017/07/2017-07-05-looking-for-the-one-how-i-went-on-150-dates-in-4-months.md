I canâ€™t honestly decide the right reaction to this. *Impressive* use of automation and science to drive to desired outcomes? *Foolish* misunderstanding of how human relationships work? Read and decide for yourself. One thought I had while reading this is if this is what an amateur can do, what are the companies that run dating platforms doing? I feel like the matchmaker of the past was an algorithm and "Big Data". The new one may be AI driven introductions and coordinated "random" encounters. The humans become the pawns in a data-driven AI manipulated show.
