Nice overview of the notes app that I use for meeting notes. I've gotten comfortable with multiple notes locations, mainly Bear and Apple Notes. I use Bear for meetings and professional things, and Apple Notes for everything else. The tagging and automation features of Bear are a huge win in a work context, but the Note sharing and ease-of-use of Apple Notes wins out at home and for personal items. I actually really like segmenting these.
