Nice writeup on the HEIF and HEVC formats that are coming to iOS 11 and macOS High Sierra. Notable that these are not Apple created formats. Anyone can implement these. I like what Apple is doing here and I think the market value will be in iPhones being able to hold more photos and video than ones not using these more modern standards. Only geeks should have to even think about the formats for most use cases.
