Good article focusing on connecting DevOps principles to business drivers. Good reading for technical folks trying to sell the business value of infrastructure work in general. The section on the board of directors is a bit odd to me though. How the work is executed is rarely a board discussion (and is almost always bad if it is), but the values may bubble up to that level of priority.
