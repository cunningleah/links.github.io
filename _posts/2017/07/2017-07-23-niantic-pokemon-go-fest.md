The [first ever Pokemon GO Fest](http://www.businessinsider.com/pokmon-go-chicago-event-issues-ticket-refunds-after-widespread-outage-2017-7) was in Chicago this last weekend. The event was interesting with a lot of special activities surrounding it. Even with what I’m sure was detailed planning and any amount of cloud infrastructure needed the service still ran into performance issues. They took action on it right away but another data point on how hard it is to scale technology infrastructure and systems for events.
