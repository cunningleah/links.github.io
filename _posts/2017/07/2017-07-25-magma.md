A completely secure, in transit and rest, open-source email system born from the ashes of [Lavabit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lavabit), which you may remember as the email service that [Edward Snowden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Snowden) used and which was shut down from legal threats and protecting itâ€™s users email. I have long argued that email is no longer something 'citizens' can do, it's a professional activity filled with spam and virus threats. However, I'm also a big fan of encrypted email and massively distributed email. The more encryption and the more distributed email is (not centralized at one or two providers) the harder it is for people to harvest and monitor it. An open-source encrypted email system is a nice step in that direction. Even better would be for it to be containerized so you could run it with little technical knowledge.
