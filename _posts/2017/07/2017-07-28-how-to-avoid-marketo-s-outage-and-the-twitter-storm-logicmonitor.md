Monitoring your DNS expiration and renewal with your registrar is very similar to monitoring SSL certificate renewal. I always monitor SSL certificates but have never monitored the domain name and registrar for registration. The failure cases seem small, and most business domains are on auto-renewal, but you could have a payment failure and an unmonitored email address case a big problem.
