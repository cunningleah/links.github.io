I’m a huge fan of what Let's Encrypt is doing with certificate management. One of the big challenges was their lack of support for wildcard certificates. Now, given that Let's Encrypt is completely programmable you could make an argument that you can manage any number of individual certificates, but it's complicated to do. This is a nice step to further adoption.
