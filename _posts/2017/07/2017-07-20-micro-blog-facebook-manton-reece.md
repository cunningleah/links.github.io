I’m a Kickstarter backer of Micro.blog and all of my status updates are sent using the Micro.blog service. Micro.blog started with syndicating content to Twitter and it has now added Facebook. This does allow for an IndieWeb principle of owning and hosting your content and then send it into the locked garden of Facebook. It’s certainly a better way to engage with Facebook, but it’s not changing my mind about being part of that community.
