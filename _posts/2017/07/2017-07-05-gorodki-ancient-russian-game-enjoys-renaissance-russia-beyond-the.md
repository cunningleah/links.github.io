Another lawn game involving wood and throwing! I enjoy [Kubb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kubb) and have recently added [MÃ¶lkky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MÃ¶lkky) to the mix as well. This looks complicated but may need to give it a try. Does every culture have a wood throwing game? ðŸ’¡ *Via [@cunngleah](https://twitter.com/cunningleah)*
