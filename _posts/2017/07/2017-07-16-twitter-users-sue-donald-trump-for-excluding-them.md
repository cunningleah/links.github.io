What a crazy set of intersecting legal questions! Can the President of the United States block a citizen from reading what he says publicly? Even more interesting is the Terms of Service coming into play. *“Trump’s account is a stream of communication that’s wholly owned by Twitter”, Mr Feldman writes.* How crazy is that?
