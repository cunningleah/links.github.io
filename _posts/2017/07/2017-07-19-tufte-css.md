I had seen a [Tufte Jekyll](https://github.com/clayh53/tufte-jekyll) theme that I really liked but it supported [Google AMP](https://www.ampproject.org/learn/overview/) and I refuse to be part of that. Itâ€™s great to see Tufte CSS now as a standalone CSS bundle that can be used independent of the things around it. Created by [Dave Liepmann](http://www.daveliepmann.com/) and now contributed directly to [Edward Tufte](https://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/).
