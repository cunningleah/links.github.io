Huge article that I mostly skimmed for the graphs. I like the visuals, and the data itself is very interesting. Seems notable that trust in other people has droped 15% in last 40 years in the United States. It's also more variable than I would have thought. Compare that to Sweden. The entire site is full of stuff like this, you could spend a lot of time here. âœ¨ Thanks [@swensn](https://twitter.com/swensn) for the link.
