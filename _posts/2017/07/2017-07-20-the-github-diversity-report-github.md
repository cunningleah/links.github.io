2nd [Diversity Report](https://diversity.github.com) from GitHub. I like to keep an eye on what tech companies are doing in this area. Diversity and inclusion is a big problem in tech and it starts with getting a handle on the data. Sharing selective data publicly is also a good way to move the tech ecosystem.
