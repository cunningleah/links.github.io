*Webmention.io is a hosted service created to easily handle webmentions (and legacy pingbacks) on any web page.* This is a handy service for static websites that want to catch references from other sites. WordPress natively handles these but static websites cannot, without something like this. I added this to [my site](http://thingelstad.com/) so I can capture web mentions.
