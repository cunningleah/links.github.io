Interesting and thought provoking article on the role of a CEO. 

> The primary CEO function, and the trait the good ones are selected for, is to provide the gyroscopic stability required to keep a company vectored in the chosen direction.

There is a lot that makes sense in this article, and a lot Iâ€™ve seen up close many times. ðŸ¤”
