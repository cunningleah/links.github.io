[Ajit Pai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajit_V._Pai) is doing exactly what everyone would expect him to be doing as Chairman of the FCC. Vertically integrated media and broadband companies (Verizon, Comcast, AT&T) will enjoy his FCC much more than anyone else. ☹️ The misleading politics on Net Neutrality are infuriating to those closer to the issue.
