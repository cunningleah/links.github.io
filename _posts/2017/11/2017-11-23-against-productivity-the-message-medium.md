This is going to sound a little weird but this article totally made me think of [GTD](http://gettingthingsdone.com) and the concept of "mind like water".

> In many ways foolishness isn’t the opposite of wisdom, but its absence. Productivity is the opposite of wisdom. Humanity is a creature of time and imagination. From these things our fruits are born more than manufactured. Productivity is a quality of perfect robots. Stories, adventures and all new things still have to come from messy humans.

It probably sounds confusing that an article condemning the focus on productivity reminds me of a productivity framework. However, the true goal of GTD is to **give your mind space and time**. Not to get more done, but to get more off your mind. To have a mind like water. This is a part of GTD that people tend to *not* focus on enough.
