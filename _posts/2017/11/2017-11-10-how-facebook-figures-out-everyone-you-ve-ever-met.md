There is an aspect of social networks, particularly big ones like Facebook, that most people don't think of at all – the information you are giving up on your friends and family. Most think they are trading their privacy for value, but in reality you are also trading your friends and families.

> Behind the Facebook profile you’ve built for yourself is another one, a shadow profile, built from the inboxes and smartphones of other Facebook users. Contact information you’ve never given the network gets associated with your account, making it easier for Facebook to more completely map your social connections.

You think you are "off" social media and never created a profile? No way. If any of the people you ever email or chat with are on social media you are. And you are connected to them. 

This activity is some of the worst to me because you do not know it is happening and there is no way to opt out.
