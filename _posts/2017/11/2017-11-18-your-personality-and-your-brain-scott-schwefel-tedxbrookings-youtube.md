I’m a big fan of [Insights Discovery](https://www.insights.com/products/insights-discovery) and an equally big fan of [Scott Schwefel](http://scottschwefel.com). I met Scott when we were both on the [CaringBridge](https://www.caringbridge.org) board and got exposed to the Insights program in an offsite we did with that board. I've brought more than a hundred people through the program at SPS and I find it an immensely valuable training and tool. I didn’t know that Scott did this [TEDx](https://www.ted.com/about/programs-initiatives/tedx-program) talk. He's a great presenter with equally great content. 👏🏻🏆
