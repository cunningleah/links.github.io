New major release of one of my favorite mind mapping tools (the other is [iThoughts](https://www.toketaware.com/ithoughts-ios)). I like MindNode's simpler and light user interface. Itâ€™s a great place to do brainstorming. Also, a [good review of this on MacStories](https://www.macstories.net/reviews/mindnode-5-digital-mind-mapping-finally-clicked-for-me/).
