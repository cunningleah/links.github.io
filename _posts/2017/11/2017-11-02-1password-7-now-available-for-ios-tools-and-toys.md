I store all my "secrets" in 1Password – passwords, banking info, software license keys and anything else that is "secret". Our whole family does via [1Password for Families](https://1password.com/families/). I’m happy to see how [AgileBits](https://agilebits.com) continues to innovate and improve this product.
