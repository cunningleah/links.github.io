I may have to give Firefox a look for the first time in several years. I love the ethos of Firefox, particularly the pro-privacy positions, but the performance has been so bad as to be comical. This is a nice, approachable writeup on how they have focused on performance. Even people that are less technical may find this interesting as it gives a glimpse into how your browser works and the complex processes involved with making software very fast.
