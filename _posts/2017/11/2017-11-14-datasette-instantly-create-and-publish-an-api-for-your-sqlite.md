This is a really cool project to make public data sets available via a JSON API. Datasette dynamically creates an API for any [SQLite database](http://sqlite.org), and there is a handy utility for Python to turn any CSV into a SQLite database. This writeup of [making a datasette for Polar Bears](https://gist.github.com/simonw/9f8bf23b37a42d7628c4dcc4bba10253) is a good overview. Super easy and simple project doing a good thing.
