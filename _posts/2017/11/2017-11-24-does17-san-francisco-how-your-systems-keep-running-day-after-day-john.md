Very good talk by [John Allspaw](https://www.kitchensoap.com/about-me/) from [DOES17](https://events.itrevolution.com/us/) (DevOps Enterprise Summit) addressing the various aspects of running software in a production environment 24x7. I like the "Above the Line" and "Below the Line" concept of systems instrumentation and observability.
