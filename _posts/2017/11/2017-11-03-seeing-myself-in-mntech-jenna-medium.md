Love this perspective and highlight from my fellow [minnestar](https://minnestar.org) board member [Jenna Pederson](http://jennapederson.com). For me this is the highlight:

> We did not sit back and wait for more women, people of color, or those from underrepresented groups to come to us. We. Went. To. Them. We actively spent time focusing on our presenter line up.

The first step for technology communities is to realize we have a problem. The next step is to do something about it, and I really like the pragmatic and thoughtful approach that Jenna, and others through her encouragement, have taken. This is how real change will happen, over time. 👏
