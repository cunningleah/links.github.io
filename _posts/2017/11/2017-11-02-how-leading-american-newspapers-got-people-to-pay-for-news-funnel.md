Whoa, nice call out in [The Economist](https://www.economist.com) to my friend [Jim Bernard](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bernardjim/) and the work his team has been doing at [Star Tribune](http://www.startribune.com)! 👏

> That gives the Star Tribune’s funnel mathematician a product to sell. Patrick Johnston, a digital executive poached from Target, the retail store, and his boss Jim Bernard, a former executive at Marketwatch, a business-news website, explain how a local newspaper’s funnel vision is different. They are, like the big papers, interested in the visitors who they call “intenders”, people whose browsing behaviour suggests they may be ready to subscribe.
