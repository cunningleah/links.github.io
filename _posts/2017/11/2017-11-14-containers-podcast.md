Good audio series in the spirit of [The Box](https://rwbook.club/book/the-box/), which [my book club](https://rwbook.club) read a long time before I joined. An amazing look into how impactful the containerization of shipping has been on the world. Also on [iTunes](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/containers/id1209559177?mt=2).
