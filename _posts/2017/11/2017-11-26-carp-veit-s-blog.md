I find it fun to read through takes on various computer languages. There are so many languages and the vast majority never got any traction. A thorough blog post reviewing a language is sort of like a vacation to another country to explore itâ€™s traditions and taste the flavors and importantly come back home shortly after. I had never heard of [Carp](https://github.com/carp-lang/Carp) but this is a thorough review of it. A Lisp language that compiles down to C to then be compiled natively.
