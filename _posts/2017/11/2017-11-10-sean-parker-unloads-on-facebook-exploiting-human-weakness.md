[Sean Parker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_Parker) was the first President of Facebook and was there for the origin. He's now become a "conscientious objector" to social media. 

> "The thought process that went into building these applications, Facebook being the first of them, ... was all about: 'How do we consume as much of your time and conscious attention as possible?'"

When I see things like this I wonder how different is this than the tobacco industry? Tobacco is naturally addicting, but social media was designed to be addicting knowing the feedback cycles of the brain. In one case the companies got lucky with tobacco, in another Facebook designed a product with every intent to create addiction. Is there a big difference? Which is worse?

Itâ€™s also notable how many tech leaders and innovators have turned off social media over recent years. Many have opted out entirely, others have clearly determined it a PR channel that they use for a specific objective.
