A new entrant into the Password (Secret) Manager space. I've been a [1Password](https://1password.com) user for years (and the whole family is safe with [1Password for Families](https://1password.com/families/)) and will stick with it. This is from the same company that makes the [TunnelBear](http://tunnelbear.com) VPN offering which I have used in the past.
