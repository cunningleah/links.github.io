I don't do a lot of multiplayer gaming but reading this got me caught up with how evolved the world of gaming has gotten. This made me think of the [Hunger Games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hunger_Games).

> I didn't intend for this to happen, but to me, the Battle Royale game mode perfectly captures the zeitgeist of the current moment, and matches my current state of mind to a disturbing degree. It's an absolutely terrifying experience of every human for themselves, winner takes all, with impossible odds. There are moments it can be thrilling, even inspiring, but mostly it's harsh and unforgiving.
