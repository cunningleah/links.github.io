This shows the amazing power that advanced editors put in the hands of their users. Even if you don't use vim or text editors this is a fun article to skim to get a sense of what technologists do with their tooling. I’m a `vim` user when I’m on a terminal, but I’m on a  tricycle compared to this setup. When I want to do real work I jump into [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com).
