Employee monitoring is an entire industry in itself. I have usually seen this for monitoring website activity to protect companies against security threats and to restrict access to inappropriate content. Itâ€™s not a big leap to take that further into general productivity monitoring and even into recommending productivity improvements for people. This is an interesting article to read just to consider what your employer may know about what is going on on your computer.

Once you leave the realm of protecting your organization and start monitoring what people are doing by keystrokes or time in applications I think you need to be really careful and I'd recommend against doing it entirely.
