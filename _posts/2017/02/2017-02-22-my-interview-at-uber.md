He then asked if I had any questions for him. I asked if they had any plans to make thing better for the drivers. He said that they were looking at various things like creating tools that would help drivers understand the real hourly rate that they were making. As if the real issue was that the drivers just did not understand how lucky they were to be driving for Uber. I asked if they considered to pay the driver more? He said that itâ€™s not ideal, since they want to keep their service as affordable as possible. He then added that I must realize that they were not competing with Taxis for the drivers, but rather with Walmart. Implying that if the drivers could earn slightly above the minimum wage driving for Uber, things were OK.
