Today's DEVONthink To Go is a deeply different iOS counterpart than the lightweight client DEVONtechnologies launched in 2010. While the first iOS version was a glorified viewer for the desktop app, the latest DEVONthink To Go is a capable mix of a file manager and research tool that takes advantage of native iOS features. DEVONthink for iOS still doesn't sport feature parity with macOS (particularly in terms of AI-infused document filing options), and there are some functionalities I'm not interested in, but there's also a lot I enjoy and want to implement in my longform writing projects.
