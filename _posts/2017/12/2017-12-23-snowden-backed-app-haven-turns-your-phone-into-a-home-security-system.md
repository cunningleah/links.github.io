This article got me thinking about other ways that your phone could be used to help your personal security. This use case is interesting and for people that have to work in random places globally (like journalists) would make sense. I wonder if there is other stuff that your phone could do at night to monitor the environment around you while you sleep. The dot projection camera on the new iPhone X is probably not strong enough to scan a room, but maybe in the future it could detect movement in a completely dark room?
