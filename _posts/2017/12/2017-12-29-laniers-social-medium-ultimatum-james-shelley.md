I love this call out from [Jaron Lanier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaron_Lanier):

> People have to take responsibility to become literate in a new way if they are going to use the technology at all. So if you just can’t find it in yourselves to delete all your social media accounts, then you must take it upon yourself to really learn how it works. Learn how the addiction cycle works. Learn how the manipulation works. Become aware of it.

We have to become much smarter customers and users of these services.
