This article is worth a read to realize how much tracking can and often does occur in your email client. I think a lot about tracking in the browser but this is a very difficult place to deal with. I don't think any email programs really offer good protection from this type of tracking. And, by the way, if you are using a tracker for personal emails? Yuck. (In full disclosure, the Weekly Thing is sent with MailChimp and it has trackers all over the place. I can't remove them unless I pay MailChimp to take them out. ðŸ˜•)
