Development teams that build software for other development teams often have a unique set of challenges. You know this is happening anytime the services and products you are building are referred to as "tools" or "tooling". The light should go off that you are still building a high quality, well designed product but your user is going to do something very different with it. I've seen this many times and I like some of the suggestions here, and have seen them used effectively. Open Meetings, Workshops and Pairing (across teams!) are great ways to engage with developers-as-users. I've wanted to do bootcamps but haven't put that to use yet. The communications highlights in this article are great callouts the many teams miss when deploying internally. üëç
