With the launch this week of Apple Pay Cash this is a nice overview of how to set it up and use it. I've sent $1 around to a bunch of friends. Works amazingly well! I think Apple Pay Cash over iMessage could be a big deal. I could easily see this at Art Fairs and other ad hoc venues to make payment.
