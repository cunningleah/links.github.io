Very cool website that allows you to see what information your browser is giving away on you and how well it fights against advertising and tracking technology. I had no idea this existed and itâ€™s great that it does. Found it via this [announcement](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/11/panopticlick-30) about the new version.
