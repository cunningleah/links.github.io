This is super cool and I might have to try this. I know our house has a wireless meter system, the electric company installed it several years ago. I've never looked into how it works but if itâ€™s this easy this could be a great way to get much more detail on our power usage. If you can get hourly, daily reports on power you should be able to connect your activities close enough to make changes to reduce usage.
