Great post and reflections from Jeff Atwood. His thoughts reflect many of the people building things in tech. I think it’s a good thing that people are becoming more introspective on the systems that they create, and asking questions about the value they are bringing.

> Software is easy to change, but people … aren't. So in the new year, as software developers, let's make a resolution to focus on the part we _can_ change, and keep asking ourselves one very important question: **how can our software help people become the best version of themselves?**

File this into that area of computer ethics that should become part of computer science curriculums.
