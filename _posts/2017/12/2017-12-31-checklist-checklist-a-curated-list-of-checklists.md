Like seeing this. After reading the [Checklist Manifesto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Checklist_Manifesto) I started a wiki at CCChecklist.org. The idea of that project was to be a [Creative Commons](https://creativecommons.org) licensed collection of checklists to share. This project is similar just using Github instead of a wiki. I never launched that project, but the concept is still really good. Minor nitpick that this is using [Github Flavored Markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/) for the checklists and I think [Taskpaper](https://www.taskpaper.com) would be a more useful and interoperable format.
