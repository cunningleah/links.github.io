I couldn't agree more with DHH on his distaste for the term "hustle". When I hear entrepreneurs use that term I cringe. I don't see any positive interpretations. DHH equals it to "the grind". I'd connect it with "to hustle", or "to steal". Hustle to me always implies creating some shell of value, with a rotten core. Build value, don't hustle.
