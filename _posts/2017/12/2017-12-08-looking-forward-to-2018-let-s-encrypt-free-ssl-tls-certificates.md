Iâ€™m a big fan of Let's Encrypt and I think they are fundamentally making the web safer and better with their work. They served **61 million** unique domains SSL certificates in 2017! That is amazing. Consider that SSL certificates easily cost $20/year (on the cheap side) that is over **$1.2 billion** in value!
