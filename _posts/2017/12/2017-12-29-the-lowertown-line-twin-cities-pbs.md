I just discovered this show while browsing through stuff on Apple TV and was excited to see episodes with a number of artists I like. [Jeremy Messersmith](http://www.tpt.org/the-lowertown-line/video/jeremy-messersmith-full-episode-the-lowertown-line-abkz5z/), [Cactus Blossoms](http://www.tpt.org/the-lowertown-line/video/lowertown-line-cactus-blossoms/) and [Trampled by Turtles](http://www.tpt.org/the-lowertown-line/video/lowertown-line-trampled-turtles/) are great places to start. üëèüé∂
