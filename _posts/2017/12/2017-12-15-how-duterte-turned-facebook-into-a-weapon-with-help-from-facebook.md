When I read [The Master Switch](https://www.amazon.com/Master-Switch-Rise-Information-Empires/dp/0307390993) I was particularly struck by the claim that large monopolies are really helpful for governments to manage and control things. It makes sense, if the government wants to monitor communications it’s easier if there is one communication service. This was the cozy pairing that AT&T had with the government before it was broken up. This article shows how a malevolent government could leverage the monopoly of Facebook in their company to achieve there ends. Worrisome examples of pretty terrible practices to manipulate a society.
