Interesting article theorizing on a possible connection between economic growth and the rise of mobile and social technology. The suggestion is that one of two things is happening: time on social is taking away from productive time or time on social is yielding a distracted population that is less productive. I would suggest both are likely true. Cal Newport [gave a thoughtful summary](http://calnewport.com/blog/2017/11/30/on-the-complicated-economics-of-attention-capital/) of this article as well.
