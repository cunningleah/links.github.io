AWS re:Invent ðŸ“£ â†’ I actually bought an Echo for us to try and use in our operations area. Idea was to make some read-only data available via voice. It didn't go anywhere in large part because the security side was too complicated. Theoretically this would solve that, but Iâ€™m pretty bearish that this offering is something that many folks would care about.
