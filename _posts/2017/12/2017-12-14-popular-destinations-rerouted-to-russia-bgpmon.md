Wow -- this is pretty interesting and a bit scary. A bad actor injecting routes into the [BGP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Border_Gateway_Protocol) system of the internet and routing large amounts of data onto foreign territory. This seems like it’s intentional and hard to imagine it’s _not_ a state sponsored activity.
