I've been thinking about the effectiveness of different types of meetings and aligning those meetings to my goals. Iâ€™m a manager more often than a maker, so my schedule is key to executing projects and tasks. This article is a strong argument for more frequent one-on-one meetings. I can see the point of making it the easiest way to get truthful and direct info. I also can see the point that group meetings can be driven by ego. But I also find one-on-one meetings to require a high amount of after meetings actions, after all you just had the one person to talk to. I also wonder about getting skewed perspective that may send people down odd tangents.
