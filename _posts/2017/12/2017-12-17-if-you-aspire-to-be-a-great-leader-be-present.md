This article hits on an important topic and one that I don't think leaders spend enough time considering. I think people can start to think they are just a logic machine going from one conversation to the other, and that the meta around them isn't relevant. Both are completely wrong. I've known for years for example that if Iâ€™m doing an important presentation I will not sit at my computer for at least 10 minutes before. I need to get my brain in a different place. I've actively changed how I mentally approach my 1:1 meetings with team members. Actively managing your own energy and knowing where you are at any given point in time is really important.
