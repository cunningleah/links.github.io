Gruber's writeup on the platform transition that the iPhone X represents is interesting. When Apple introduced the iPhone 8 and the iPhone X I told a number of folks this is the transition point. I fully expect there to be an iPhone 9 and iPhone XI (let's hope the roman numerals go away). What we are seeing is the transitional period from the first arc of the iPhone and iOS to the second big arc, and during that time we'll have some overlap to allow users and apps to transition and for the cost curve to come down on the new tech. This is something that nobody has ever done at this scale, and those that have done it have not done it well. Think Mac OS 9 to Mac OS X or whatever flavor of Windows to Windows the next flavor.
