This is pretty cool! üëè Email by default has no security features. And adding encryption to email is shockingly difficult. I've tried doing PGP plugins before and it is a nightmare. [ProtonMail](https://protonmail.com) makes a very robust and entirely encrypted webmail product, but their limitation to a regular mail client is a big gap. This ProtonMail Bridge is a really ingenious way of delivering secure, encrypted email to Mail clients that have no idea how to deal with security!
