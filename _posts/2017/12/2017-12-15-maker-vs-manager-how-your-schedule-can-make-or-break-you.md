This has a good writeup on the Maker v. Manager subject that Paul Graham originally wrote up. I like this article because it goes into more examples of how people use these and very importantly how people use both. I find that I need to effectively use both schedule types to achieve my objectives and being clear about which you are using at different points is critical.
