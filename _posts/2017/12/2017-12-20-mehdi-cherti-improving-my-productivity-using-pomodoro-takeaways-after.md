Fun to see someone doing some analytics on their productivity system. I've tried Pomodoro and it doesn't work well for what I do. I suspect that is a bit of the maker v. manager schedule issue at play. I also don't know that you should blend GTD and Pomodoro. But, I liked this writeup and like that he used a simple shell script to make it all work. I also like that this is reflecting on two years of data.
