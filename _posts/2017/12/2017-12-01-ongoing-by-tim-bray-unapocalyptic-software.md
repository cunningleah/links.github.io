I love this writeup by Tim Bray on what software development is actually like.

> It’s like this: You sit down to im­prove a piece of soft­ware, make a cou­ple of changes, and sud­den­ly a lot of unit tests are fail­ing, leav­ing ug­ly red trails on your screen. (In fac­t, if you made changes and didn’t break unit test­s, you wor­ry that something’s wrong.) But then you dig in­to them one by one, and af­ter not too long, it’s all back to green; which is re­al­ly a good feel­ing.

Fun read, and very accurate.
