I’m liking some of these holiday gift lists I’m seeing come through my feeds lately.

  1. [Nintendo Switch](https://www.nintendo.com/switch/) is on my list for this year. I continue to hear very good things about the Switch from everyone that I ask.
  2. The Magnetic Pencil Sleeve is a good idea.
  3. I have [AirPods](https://www.apple.com/airpods/) and completely agree that they are amazing.
  4. The Caps for Apple Pencil is also a good idea for folks that have more than one.
  5. I just got a [ScanSnap iX500](http://www.fujitsu.com/us/products/computing/peripheral/scanners/scansnap/ix500/) myself and it is a great device.
