AWS re:Invent ðŸ“£ â†’ Graph databases are a bear to pick, use and run. AWS offering a cloud hosted graph database will hopefully address all of these issues. There are a large number of use cases where graph databases make a lot of sense but so many people have been burned by them that they tend to solve a graph problem using a document or relational database.

Itâ€™s cool to see that this supports RDF and SPARQL, core concepts of the [Semantic Web](https://www.w3.org/standards/semanticweb/). It also supports [TinkerPop3](https://tinkerpop.apache.org/) (really? can we get better names?).
