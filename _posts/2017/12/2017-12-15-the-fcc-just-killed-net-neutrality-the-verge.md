As expected the Net Neutrality rules were voted down in a 3-2 vote at the FCC. Expect to hear from opponents of net neutrality that after the vote the internet is still working. Erosion of neutrality will take a while. Companies aren't dumb, they will slowly start charging more. For the foreseeable future itâ€™s important to start thinking about how to manage around this and put pressure on the corporations.
