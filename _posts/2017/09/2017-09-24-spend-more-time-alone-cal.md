This post struck a chord with me, particularly the framing of solitude as “the real key to solitude is to step away from reacting to the output of other minds”. Reflect on your day and think how often that happens. Not enough I would guess. 

When I think of how mobile technology combined with social media has infiltrated our lives I think of spray foam. If you fill a hole with spray foam it’s remarkable to watch it grow, spread and fill every space it can occupy. When we reflexively reach for those inputs, other people’s thoughts, so consistently we drown out even small moments of solitude.
