Love this deep mathematical look at roasting coffee beans using a more advanced model:

> Our mathematical model uses multiphase physics to describe the evolution of the solid, liquid, and gas components within the coffee bean. This is a crucial difference from previous attempts to model coffee roasting, as existing models treated the coffee bean as a single “bulk” material.

A properly sophisticated model with precise measurement combined with a machine learning approach could result in a fabulous, consistent and even personalized roast! ☕️ Hat tip to [Isaiah](https://twitter.com/keating_isaiah) for the link!
