Iâ€™m still firmly opposed to introducing technology to my grilling and smoking setup. I believe the best smoked food comes from careful management of fire and air combined with wisdom. With that said, these DIY tech projects are pretty fun to read about. Thanks to [Dan Grigsby](https://twitter.com/dcgrigsby) for the link.
