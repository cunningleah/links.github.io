I looked into [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) a while back and was very impressed, but [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com) native support for Jekyll keeps things really simple. This post highlights an interesting path to make a transition and introduced me to the very impressive [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) service. I will very likely be moving [Link Thing](http://links.thingelstad.com) to Hugo for performance reasons alone.
