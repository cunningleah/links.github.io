At one time [John Siracusa](https://twitter.com/siracusa) was known for his [meticulous reviews of Mac OS X](https://arstechnica.com/author/john-siracusa/). Now [Frederico Viticci](https://twitter.com/viticci) is known for his similar [reviews of iOS](https://www.macstories.net/?s=iOS+%22The+MacStories+Review%22). In my opinion, nobody writes about an Apple event like Gruber. Great stuff, enjoyable everytime.
