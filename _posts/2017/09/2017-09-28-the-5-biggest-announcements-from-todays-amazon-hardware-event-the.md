Amazon clearly knows they have something with the Echo lineup. The Echo Spot is pretty interesting and is a smart targeted play. I could see the benefits of having a cheap voice controlled device on the nightstand. The Echo Button is a total surprise. Sounds like it’s a Bluetooth lighted button that will be used to extend into gaming. I’m impressed with where Amazon is taking this platform, I just wish it could play with the iOS ecosystem better.
