This is more interesting information from Cloudflare:

> We found that between 4% and 10% of the webâ€™s encrypted traffic (HTTPS) is intercepted. Analyzing these intercepted connections further reveals that, while not always malicious, interception products most often weaken the encryption used to secure communication and puts users at risk.

That is more encrypted traffic interception than I would have ever guessed. ðŸ”‘
