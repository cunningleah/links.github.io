[John Allspaw](https://www.kitchensoap.com/about-me/) writing about the evolution of architecture review processes at [Etsy](https://www.etsy.com). Some interesting phases to their evolution that I can relate to very well. I like the fundamental definition of engineering not being provably correct or best. That is something that we don't acknowledge enough. I also really appreciate the perspective on the power dynamics of these conversations. Another thing that isn't considered enough.
