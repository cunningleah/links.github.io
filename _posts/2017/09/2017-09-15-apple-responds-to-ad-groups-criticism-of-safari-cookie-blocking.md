Love the first line of Apple's response to this criticism from creepy ad networks **"Apple believes that people have a right to privacy…"** I don't want to dress Apple up as being only on ethical grounds here. I believe that they have identified a long-term strategy against Google around privacy. Their long bet is that over time people will care. I care today and am really happy to see them continuing to push privacy as a feature!
