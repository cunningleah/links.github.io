I’m a fan of Python and almost all the (very little) coding I do I do in Python. I find the language approachable, powerful and it has a fabulous ecosystem. With that all said, I’m still amazed at this graph showing Pythons phenomenal growth over other languages.

The additional observation that Python is not growing as fast in "non-high-income" countries isn't answered here, but it seems obvious to me that that is driven by outsourcing. Python applications are likely not the norm for outsourcing to global consulting firms. That is still dominated by traditional languages like Java and C#. But given time I would expect that curve to look similar to other regions with a time delay of a couple of years.
