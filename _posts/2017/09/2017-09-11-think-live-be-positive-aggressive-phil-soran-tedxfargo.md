Great [TEDxFargo](http://tedxfargo.com) talk from [Phil Soran](https://www.linkedin.com/in/phil-soran-a802616a/), successful tech entrepreneur and also an [SPS Commerce](https://www.spscommerce.com) board member. His culture view of *positive aggressive* culture is great. I like naming the culture and having explicit discussions about it.
