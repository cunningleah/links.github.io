This pleases me greatly -- that these ad networks are worried about the new [Intelligent Tracking Prevention](https://webkit.org/blog/7675/intelligent-tracking-prevention/) feature in Safari tells me it might have a real impact to protect users privacy. Thematically this is one of the reasons I use Safari. Google has no motivation to work for users privacy in Chrome. Remember Chrome was the [last browser to support Do Not Track](http://www.zdnet.com/article/googles-chrome-finally-embraces-do-not-track-but-with-a-warning/).
