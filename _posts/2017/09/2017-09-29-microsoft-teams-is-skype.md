This is a good move! 👏 Skype for Business gives the Skype brand a bad name. It’s just Lync with different branding and Lync was a hot mess from the first step. Teams isn't perfect, but Microsoft will have an easier time bringing Teams to where they want to go versus dragging the dead-weight of Lync around. 👍
