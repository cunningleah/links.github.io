Alright, so I've said many times that QR codes are dumb and have no utility. I may have to take some of that back. Putting a QR code in the house that a visitor can hit with their camera and jump on the WiFi network is a pretty slick use case. I'll put one up and see if anyone is able to use it.

I still love [Pictures of People Scanning QR-codes](http://picturesofpeoplescanningqrcodes.tumblr.com)! ðŸ¤£
