Based on David Spark's recommendation I purchased [Flower](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/flower/id1279174518?mt=8&uo=4&at=1001lxyE&ct=thingelstad_com) this morning and it is a treat. Fun and relaxing game with very nice animations and gameplay. It takes a bit to figure out what you are doing, but after you get the hang of it it’s a lot of fun.
