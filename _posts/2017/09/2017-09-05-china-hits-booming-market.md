It is really hard to know how much of the recent rise in [Bitcoin](https://bitcoin.org/en/) and [Ethereum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethereum) is due to [Initial Coin Offerings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial_coin_offering) but the degree of reaction to this news from China will be one sign. It will be curious if the US takes similar action. ðŸ’¸
