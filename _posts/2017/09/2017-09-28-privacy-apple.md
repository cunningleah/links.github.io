> Apple products are designed to do amazing things. And designed to protect your privacy.

Apple outlining the work that they do in various platforms and services to protect your privacy. They don't mention Google here but they don't need to. I continue to believe that Apple has a long-term position that this is important, even if consumers don't value it highly today. The [Approach to Privacy](https://www.apple.com/privacy/approach-to-privacy/) page is worth a read too.
