The graphs in this article tell the story of the dropping prices of industrial robots. Look at those graphs and then think of the employment in the industrial sector. Now what would the graph of Industrial Robot Cost look like if overlaid on the employment cost of people. Itâ€™s concerning where this goes, but seems inevitable.

> As machine learning and new sensing capabilities impact them, not only will their performance improve but other costs associated with installation and integration should fall as well. For example, they will require little or no human programming and will be able to roam freely instead of being trapped in safety cages and by other barriers.
