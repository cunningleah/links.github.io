Tim Bray catching on a number of articles that I've also seen. When I read articles like this I can’t help but going back to the root of things and reminding everyone that there are no ethics classes taught to technologists. Our industry is one that rarely even puts that topic on the table. We are creating a world of software and hardware that many people live inside of without really understanding what we are doing, and the tradeoffs implicit in it.
