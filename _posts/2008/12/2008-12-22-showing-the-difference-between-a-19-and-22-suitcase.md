What size rolling luggage to buy? Shopping at Amazon, it feels like a shot in the dark.







Lots of closeups of handles and wheels, but what’s the difference between a 19” or 22” bag? There’s no real guidance.



This is the kind of situation where a site that focuses on a specific niche can really shine.




Luggage Online offers a size chart (and Carry-On Luggage Regulations for each airline too).




eBags also offers a Rolling Luggage Size Guide.



Sometimes, a little context makes all the difference.
