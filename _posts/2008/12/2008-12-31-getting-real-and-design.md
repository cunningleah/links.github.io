Ive only known one method for approaching a Design project. There are many variations out there, but it can essentially be broken down into 4 steps: Discover, Plan, Design/Develop, and Deploy. It didnt matter where I workedagency or internal design departmentthese were the steps, and I didnt question them.



Then 37signals published Getting Real, and I wondered if this might be a better way of approaching a project. Id like to share with you a few stories from past Design projects while reflecting on how Getting Real would have helped. Ill also share some insight into how the process here at 37signals works.
