[A cartoon from 2007 etc.]It's no big deal. I liked Twitter. But I found it too easy.


I think my time would be better spent drawing cartoons and writing books.


That's just how I feel.


[UPDATE:] This story seems to have made it onto the front page of Techmeme. Lots of people talking about it. Wow.


[UPDATE:] An archive of my Tweets can be found here.


[UPDATE:] A couple of hundred e-mails later, I restored the Twitter account. You can read again it here.
