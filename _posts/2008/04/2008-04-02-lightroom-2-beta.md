Version 2 of Lightroom is now available as a public beta, allowing the the photographic community to provide feedback on  new features and workflow enhancements.  It's hard to believe that Lightroom 1.0 was released just over a year ago and Lightroom 1.1 shortly thereafter.  It really feels like the beta process never stopped and we've received a ton of great feedback through the feature request submissions, customer conversations, forum discussions, tradeshows and targeted customer visits. We're glad to continue the process by releasing this version before it's final to get your opinions on our progress.  This is different from the previous Lightroom beta in that we'll be targeting feedback on new enhancements and aiming to release the final version sooner than we did in the previous year-long beta.   I've provided a few key notes below but I strongly recommend reading the entire Release Notes document available on Labs.adobe.com.

Beta Eligibility

Q: Who is eligible for the   Lightroom 2.0 beta?
  A: 
    All Lightroom 1.0 customers.   Lightroom 1.0 customers can download and install Lightroom 2.0 beta for  use throughout the beta program

Q: What about customers new to Lightroom?
  A: 
    Anyone can download the Lightroom 2.0 beta and try it for 30  days

Q: How can new customers try the beta for the entire program?
  A: 
    An invitation program   through labs.adobe.com allows Lightroom 1.0 customers to invite  friends  to try the beta beyond  the 30 day trial until the beta expiration  date

Q: When does the beta expire?
  A: 
    August 31, 2008

 

IMPORTANT NOTES, PLEASE READ

Primary Known Issues


  Lightroom 2.0 beta will not upgrade  Lightroom 1.x libraries.  The beta is intended to be used for testing  and feedback purposes.  Lightroom 1.x and  2.0 beta libraries will be migrated to the finished version of Lightroom 2.0.
  While data loss is  not expected, this is a very early ‘beta’ quality build and you should always  work on duplicates of files that are securely backed up.  
  Lightroom 2 beta  will not overwrite or interfere with a machine that currently has Lightroom  1.3.1 installed.  
  Develop settings applied in Lightroom 2.0  beta are not guaranteed to transfer correctly to the final version of 2.0.  This is particularly true for localized  corrections.
  The new Photoshop  integration functionality is only available with Photoshop CS3 (10.0.1) and  should only be used for testing purposes.   Metadata associated with the original file may not carry over to the  subsequent file saved from Photoshop
  Additional known  issues are listed in the release notes.

    Trust me, we haven't forgotten about the photographers who are awaiting a replacement to the Lightroom 1.4 update that we released and subsequently pulled from Adobe.com.  
  Lightroom 1.4.1 and Camera Raw 4.4.1 are currently undergoing additional testing before we release them in the first half of April.  Thank you for your patience.
