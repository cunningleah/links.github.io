Rails 2.1 is not far off the horizon and weve been adding a ton of extra deliciously nice goodies in preparation of its release lately. As always, the good Ryan Daigle has been keeping a watchful eye on the changelog and has been documenting some of the new features. The latest stars are:




Gem Dependencies
Dirty tracking with partial updates
has_finder in the form of named_scope
Built-in timezone support
Better caching infrastructure
