It's weird how bloggers, gossip types and
"Web 2.0" company founders and execs have developed into this strange
pseudo-celebrity sphere, where many of them are constantly stroking
each other. What's unfortunate about it is that the podcasts, blogs and
other media I've consumed from the tech world are becoming hopelessly
out of touch.
I know I've previously blogged about this with regards to Leo Laporte and the This Week in Tech gang's comments about how "nobody uses .NET," but reverse awareness is also getting out of hand. This post from Scoble is one of countless about Twitter,
and it's hopelessly out of touch. The comments on the post seem to
concur. Twitter has become something of a flagship for attention
whoring, especially in that pseudo-celebrity community. Seriously, I'm
so tired of hearing about it, about how great it is and it's changing
the world.
I'm not generally one to be a poopy pants about new
technology, but I agree with the comments about how this thing is a
niche feature for something else, not a business. VC's keep sinking
money into it, and for what? It feels like 2000 all over again.
And
it wouldn't be so damn annoying if it weren't for the constant, "This
is our attention whoring party and we're so awesome," kinds of posts
and comments. Seriously, take it to your average high school, and
they'll be like, "Yeah, I can send text messages, what do I need this
for?" Even kids who live for attention don't see the value in this.
The
pseudo-celebrities are living unbalanced lives, as far as I'm
concerned, which probably contributes to their lack of perspective on
Twitter's true impact. I don't think it's an over-generalization to say
that most people outside the valley don't feel any need to share when
they take a dump to their followers, or know when the followers are
taking a dump. There are so many more important things going on at all
times, and this constant connection noise is, in my opinion, a waste of
time.
Do any of these people turn off the electronic devices and
spend time with their kids, pets, a book or a movie or whatever? Is
this "knowledge" about what everyone else does really that important?
