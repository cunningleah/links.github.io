Twitter visualizations are nothing new, but they always provide a great way to waste some time.  The newest, TwittEarth, is eye-candy at its finest - a mesmerizing and mostly useless diversion that sticks you in space and whips you around the globe to see a new geo-located tweet every ten seconds.  Tweets are accompanied by small, goofy icons that remain static on the map, eventually providing an interesting representation of usage distribution. 

The app itself is very simple at this point.  There dont seem to be any settings to speak of, and there isnt any way to stray from the default view. Users can login to the application and send their own messages, but its far more fun to zone out and watch tweets pop up around the globe.  

TwittEarth is available as a Windows screen saver (a Mac version is on the way), and was created by Digitas France SA.
