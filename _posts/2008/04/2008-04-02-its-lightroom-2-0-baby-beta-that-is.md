Hey folks! I bet Ive got one heck-of-a surprise for you today. Ready for it? Adobe has released Lightroom 2.0 beta to the public (no, this is not a belated April fools day joke). Today kicks off Photoshop World and not only is Adobe going to demo the 2.0 beta but theyre letting everyone have it and download it for free. The first question everyones going to be asking is whats it all about. Ive included my top 10 favorite features in 2.0 right here. However, NAPP has an entire learning center website all set up with videos (by Scott Kelby and myself) on all the new features. Ill give you the links at the end of the post.

First, the top 10 list1) Localized Corrections (AKA: Dodge and Burn) - If Lightroom 2 came out and this was the only new feature Id upgrade in a heartbeat. Localized Corrections is the non-destructive dodging and burning that weve all wanted for so long. But I have to say this - its so much more. It goes WAY beyond what I expected from dodging and burning in Lightroom (which is why its called Localize corrections and not just dodge and burn) and I think youre going to love it.
2) Better Photoshop Integration - Now you can open your files as Smart Objects, Merge to Panorama or even export straight to Photoshops HDR from Lightroom.
3) Post-crop vignetting - if youve ever tried to darken the edges of a cropped photo with the lens vignetting slider youll know it doesnt really work. Thats where the post-crop vignette comes in.
4) Multiple Monitor support - can you say Finally!?
5) Picture Packages in the print module.
6) Output Sharpening in the print module and it really works this time around. Ive seen tests compared to Lightroom 1 and the print sharpening is noticeably better.
7) Smart Collections - Collections were great in LR 1 but smart collections make using collections a lot easier.
8.) Printing directly to a JPEG file in the Print module. So if you send your photos off to a lab now you can save the files right from within Lightrooms Print module.
9) Suggested Keywords - Get this Lightroom will start suggesting keywords to you once you start keywording your photos. Its weird to explain so make sure you stop by NAPPs learning center to see it in action.
10) OK, Im going to give you two here. First theres a new filter panel in the Library module that makes getting to your photos easier and faster because its right there with your photos (instead of tucked away on the left side panels). Next, the Slideshow and Web modules both have Content panels as well as Collection panels. So now you can very quickly switch slideshows without having to jump back to the Library module and choose different photos. 

Now for the links to find out moreI know I promised some links so here they are:
