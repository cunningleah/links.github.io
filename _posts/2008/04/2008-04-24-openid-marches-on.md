First, JanRain (who run the myOpenID provider service) have come out with an ID Selector widget for web developers. Drop their javascript on your page, and theyll create a control to make it easy for a user to pick their own provider and sign in to your site. Lowering the friction of OpenID use will contribute to its spread.
