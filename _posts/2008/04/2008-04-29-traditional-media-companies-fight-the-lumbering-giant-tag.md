That was the question moderator and EconSM conference editorial director Elizabeth Osder put to a panel of old media companies representing WSJ and its close relations, as well as Time Inc., Gannett (NYSE: GCI) and Martha Stewart. Upshot? While some collectively conceded to being somewhat lumbering in the past, thats not the case anymore.
