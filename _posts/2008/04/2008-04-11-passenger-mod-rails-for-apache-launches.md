The guys at Phusion has finally wrapped up Passenger, their mod_rails-like module for Apache. Its looking like a great, easy solution for people who want a more PHP-like deployment story. Just dump your files in a directory setup with a vhost and off you go. Touch tmp/restart.txt and the application is restarted. Doesnt get much simpler than that.
