Two weeks after Apple release the 2.0.1 update for the Apple TV, the company has released yet another update.  And just like the 2.0.1 update, nobody knows exactly what this update is for.


Some members of the MacRumors forums have reported (http://www.macrumors.com/2008/04/14/apple-quietly-releases-apple-tv-2-02-update/)  that the user interface is much smoother now.  Other than that, there are no obvious changes.


If you think you know why Apple released this update, please shed some light.
