Over on his blog Alexander van Elsas has taken some time and wrung some FriendFeed usage stats. He says his reasons for doing this were fairly straightforward. He wanted to see if that actions of users are shared with others without intent, that is the person performing the action is intentionally sharing, the content that gets shared is usually less valuable.

Alexanders conclusion once he had sliced and diced the data that FriendFeed was really nothing more than a techie bloggers echo chamber. Although not all doom and gloom about the service he does have some suggestions that even make FriendFeed a serious contender for Techmemes spot as the leading resource for bloggers.

All in all it is an interesting read and well worth taking some time to look it over.
