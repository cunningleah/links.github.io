Mr. 28% is now the most unpopular president in Gallup history.
   President Bush has set a record he'd presumably prefer to avoid: the highest disapproval rating of any president in the 70-year history of the Gallup Poll.
  In a USA TODAY/Gallup Poll taken Friday through Sunday, 28% of Americans approve of the job Bush is doing; 69% disapprove. The approval rating matches the low point of his presidency, and the disapproval sets a new high for any president since Franklin Roosevelt.
  The previous record of 67% was reached by Harry Truman in January 1952, when the United States was enmeshed in the Korean War. 
  You know what makes this number particularly amazing? Bush, post-9-11, notched the highest approval ratings in Gallup history. So he literally went from the most popular president, to the most hated. The whole country is celebrating their Bush Derangement Syndrome!
  And McCain is eager to follow in his footsteps.
