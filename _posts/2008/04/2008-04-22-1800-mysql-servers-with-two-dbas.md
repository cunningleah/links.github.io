Here’s a statistic I love, Facebook is running
1,800 MySQL Servers with only 2 DBAs. Impressive. I love seeing services show how
far you can go towards admin-free operation. 2:1,800 is respectable and for database
servers it downright impressive. This data from a short but interesting report at: http://www.paragon-cs.com/wordpress/?p=144. 




 




The Facebook fleet has grown fairly dramatically
of late.   For example, Facebook is the largest Memcached
installation and the most recent
reports I had come across have 200
Memcached servers at facebook.
 At the Scaling
MySQL panel, they report 805 Memcached
servers. 




 




1,800 MySQL Servers, insulated by 805 Memcached
servers, and driven by 10,000 web servers. Smells like success.
