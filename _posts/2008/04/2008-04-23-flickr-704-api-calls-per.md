As announced on the Flickr Blog, Flickr has launched a new website for developers: Flickr Code. And besides announcing the new site theyve both a) given interesting details on just how much API traffic they do each day (see below), and b) they announced theyre open sourcing Flickr Uploadr, the cross-platform (Windows and OS X) desktop tool for uploading photos to Flickr. 

New at Flickr Code, you can find:


a weblog (Code: Flickr Developer Blog )
a ticket tracker
a public subversion repository

Uploadr is built on on Mozillas XUL Runner. Now that Uploadr is open source, developers can customize and extend its functionality. Maybe you will  want to apply specific effects  (such as watermarking) to your photos before uploading them. More radically, perhaps Uploadr can be transformed to be a full-function desktop UI to Flickr, to become a Viewr and Downloadr all in one. Maybe developers will extend the Flickr Uploadr to talk to sites other than Flickr. The potential is there for all this development.

How to get started with hacking Uploadr? A good starting point is Flickr Uploadr, start to finish now to learn about the challenges of developing cross-platform apps using XULRunner.  Check out the video interview with developer Rob Crowley to get an in-depth story. You can also join the discussion at the Flickr Group Hacking Uploadr.

Even though the open source Uploadr is the big announcement coming from code.flickr.com, dont miss the fascinating glimpse that the  announcement provides into the tremendous buzz  continuing around the venerable Flickr API (which you may know as the 2nd most mashed up API listed in ProgrammableWeb with 329 Flickr mashups listed):

In the last week we deployed new code to Flickr 50 times, including 546 changes by 16 people. We issued over 2,000 new API keys, and third party developers made an average of 704 API calls per second, across 109 public API methods.   We added 1 new API method, and updated 7 others.   There are approximately 10,000 lines of open source code in our public subversion repository.
