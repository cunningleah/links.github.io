Were fans of services that leverage data that youve already collected; re-entering things is not only inelegant, its time-wasting. If youre a del.icio.us user (and most web workers seem to be), you can get double use out of some of your bookmark data with the new site del.ishli.st. As you might guess from the name, the site collects all items you put on del.icio.us with the tag wishlist, making it a place you can send the average internet user to see your wishlist.

Theres plenty more here, all based on parsing del.icio.us information: filtering by tags, images, sort by ranking, descriptions, and ways to add someone elses items to your own wishlist. Its paid for by Google Ads and Amazon referral links. Makes us wonder what other data could be mined from del.icio.us.
