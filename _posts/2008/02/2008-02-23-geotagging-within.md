Geotag-lightroom-plugin is a Beta Geotagging plugin for Lightroom created by Jeff Barnes. It utilises a feature of the Export SDK, whereby you can create a menu item within Lightroom. The plugin reads GPX information and writes it to the file in Lightroom using Exiftool.
Features include:

Sync photo to GPS using picture of GPS display
Interpolate location between track points
Add geotags to original images or save to new location
While there are some issues, the plugin works “for the most part”. Installation instructions and download information can be got at the Plugin homepage.
