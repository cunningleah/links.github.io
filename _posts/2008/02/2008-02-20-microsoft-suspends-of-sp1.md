Following reports by users of problems resulting from new Vista Service Pack (SP) 1 installation prerequisite update – which Microsoft pushed out via Windows Update last week — Microsoft has halted availability of those prerequisites.

Microsoft announced on February 19 via the Vista Team Blog its decision to stop the distribution of the Vista SP1 prerequisites.
