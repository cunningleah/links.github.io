Well, this is the first time I'm blogging on our corporate blog and I've got to thank Mario for roping me into this. Today, I'd like to announce LinkedIn mobile for any Web enabled wireless phones that use the wireless application protocol (WAP). What that allows you to do is access LinkedIn from any mobile device ranging from your Blackberry to iPhone (more on that in just a second). 


For those of you who can't wait to take LinkedIn with you on your mobile devices, here's how you access LinkedIn on your iPhone or other WAP enabled devices. All you have to do from your mobile device is log into 
http://m.linkedin.com/
The beta product includes a version specially optimized for the iPhone and is available immediately in English, French, German, Spanish, Japanese and Chinese with additional languages to follow.


So, here's a short video overview (3:36) of LinkedIn mobile. 






And, here's Jerry Luk, the lead engineer on LinkedIn mobile giving you a quick demo (4:36) of how to access LinkedIn on your iPhone. For those of you who don't have the time to check out the iPhone demo, feel free to check out five key benefits of using LinkedIn mobile (with screen shots below). 






LinkedIn Features on your mobile device (as of Feb 24, 2008): 





 Search LinkedIn profiles (including photos and bio) to help recall and connect with business acquaintances at events and conferences 





 Research the common contacts they have with other professionals to help make real world referrals and introductions easier





 Invite professional acquaintances and peers you meet at events to LinkedIn with just their email address. Exchanging business cards is just not cool anymore! 





 Receive regular Network update capabilities about your connections while on the go







 International versions currently launched include French, German, Spanish, Japanese and Chinese. More to follow.




We're also working on expanding the mobile LinkedIn feature
set to encompass more of the LinkedIn goodness you can access on our
site, including LinkedIn Answers and LinkedIn Experts. (Click through the above screen shots for a better view of LinkedIn Mobile).
