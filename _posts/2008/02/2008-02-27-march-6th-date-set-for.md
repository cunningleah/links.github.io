Apple has sent out an email to the media announcing a March 6th event for laying out an iPhone Software Roadmap that will focus on the SDK as well as new enterprise features.  Its not clear whether the SDK will actually be released on that date, or whether it will just be detailed. In either case, Apple has failed to fulfill its promise to release the SDK this February as anticipated.  The event will be invite-only and will take place at Apple headquarters in Cupertino, starting at 10am.  While nothing has been said about which enterprise features will exactly be discussed, business users are obviously hoping that they will include some sort of Microsoft Exchange support.
