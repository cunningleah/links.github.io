Well, today, Saturday, you can now check out Minnov8.com -- "Minnesota Technology Innovation News & Insights." After talking about it for months, it's finally a reality. Well, kind of a soft-launch, anyway. Trouble is, starting in January, we all got really busy, but we decided we had enough content in the can, as it were, that we should go, at least with a few posts to get started. (More is coming as we speak.) My first post was about innovation in angel investing, a topic I'm very close to and have also written about here on Tech~Surf~Blog, as well as on GetGoMN.org.
