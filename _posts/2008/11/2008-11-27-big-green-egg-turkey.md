BGE heated up to 350 degrees with platesetter legs UP and Pie Pan between the disposable drip pan and the platesetter (keeps from scorching the juice). Place turkey on a V-Rack. I used 36 ounces of chicken broth an onion, celery and carrots (broth for basting). After one hour, baste often...when temp hits remove.This was a 13.8 Lb. Bird and it took exactly 3 hours. Happy TurkeyDay!
