We all love WordPress, but sometimes it can get just really, really slow. And no matter how we look for the cause, sometimes theres just no way to figure out whats been giving your WordPress installation the hiccups. Thank goodness somebody came up with WP-Tuner.

WP-Tuner for WordPress is a powerful and easy way to answer hard questions about why your blog is slow or cranky. Whats causing the slowdown? Is it a plugin? Is it your host? This plugin will help you find out. One problem, though, with this particular plugin is that its not for the novice. Advanced WP users will be able to understand what the plugin tells them, but it may not be that obvious for everyone.

WP-Tuner is recommended to be used by:


WordPress site administrators
WordPress plugin and theme designers
WordPress developers

WP-Tuner can also be used with a number of advanced ways, like hooking any WordPress action to it. You can even use it to time anything at all in WordPress.

Installing WP-Tuner is as easy as installing any other plugin: upload using your favorite FTP client, and activate via the plugins page. Be sure to read the plugins readme file and the associated help documents before using it.

Used with a bit of common sense, this powerful plugin will help blog administrators as well as software developers improve their WordPress blog performance.
