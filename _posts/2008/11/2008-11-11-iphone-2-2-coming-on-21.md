 iPhone Hellas (via Giz) is hella sure that the newest version of the iPhone OS 2.2 (including the Google Maps features, application scoring and direct download of podcasts) is going to be ready to go in time for you to show the whole family on Thanksgiving.  Will it have Push notifications?        No, but maybe for Christmas ...if you are good.
