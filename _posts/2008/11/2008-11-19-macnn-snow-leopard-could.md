Filed under: Macworld, Rumors, Snow Leopard Snow Leopard could ship as early as January, according to comments made by the director of Apple's Unix Technology Group.  Jordan Hubbard said at the Large Installation System Administration conference last week that Mac OS X 10.6 will ship in the first quarter of 2009, according to MacNN.  This primes the Macworld Expo rumor pump: Scheduled for January 5, Steve could debut new quad-core iMacs in addition to showing off this new version of the operating system.  This is not to be confused with Mac OS X 10.5.6, a minor update, which could be available as soon as Friday.
