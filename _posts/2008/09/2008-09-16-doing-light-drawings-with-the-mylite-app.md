A photographer only identified as bjeung has posted a fun set of images on Flickr that were made using our myLite app. He captured several shots of his iPhone screen casting colored light in a darkened setting, against a dark background.  We assume the photographer was using the Trippin setting of our app, which runs through all the colors available and lets you select the speed of the color change from 0.1 sec to 0.5 sec. We assume he set his camera for a timed exposure, on a tripod, and moved his iPhone around quickly to create these drawings. Congratulations, bjeung  theyre cool!
