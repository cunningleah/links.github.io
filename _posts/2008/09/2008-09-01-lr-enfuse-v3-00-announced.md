Timothy Armes has announced that LR/Enfuse version 3.00 is finally here.

After many requests Tim added a batch processing option.  Simply group images to be blended into stacks, select all and then run enfuse in batch mode.

As an added bonus LR/Enfuse can now automatically reimport the blended images and even stack them with the originals.

Both of these new features require Lightroom 2.
