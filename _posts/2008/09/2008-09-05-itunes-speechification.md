Doesn't matter whether you're a Republicrat or a Demublican, or if you're blue, red, or purple. If you've got an interest in World Events, the US iTunes stores has all the speeches from the recent American conventions -- from both sides of the aisle.
 The speeches and video highlights are free and available as podcasts for your delectation (and bonus raised blood pressure, where applicable).
Pretty much everyone wants the same good things for the US and the world. Let these speeches help you decide which side can get you there.
 Thanks, Gordon Werner
