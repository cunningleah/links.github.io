Quick Side-note: Until this downtime, I had no idea how much I use Cullect to remember the URLs of my favorite news sources for me. In my head, they’re all rolled up in a reading list.

Back to the update. Two things are happening simultaneously to get Cullect back online quickly, more reliability, and generally better.


The current server is being upgraded with a ton more storage (your membership payments at work). When I receive confirmation from Joyent that the upgrade is complete, Cullect as you know it will be back. I’m expecting this confirmation shortly. 
A fresh, new server is being prepped for the ‘Big Train to Hollywood’ version. The initial steps of this are complete, to move forward the current server needs to be online.

I’ve tried a couple of strategies for getting Cullect back up - in anyway possible - prior to the storage upgrade, but I don’t have to tell you they didn’t work. 

If you’re interested in scaling web apps - when the ‘Big Train’ launches Cullect will have a dedicated database server and a dedicated application server. To date both have been fighting for the same resources. Giving them their own space will make them (and you and I) happier and faster overall. Linda over at Joyent sent me a straight-forward, 10-step recipe for scaling this way and I’m anxious to get it started. 

Again, I’m sorry for the multi-day outage. Thank you for your patience as I get the upgrade in place to get Cullect back up and insure this kind of outage doesn’t happen again.
