Today we’re pleased to announce a long overdue feature – private IPs for customers with multiple slices. Those of you load-balancing across slices, employing a database cluster/server or syncing between slices will find this option perfect for inter-slice communication. Most importantly, bandwidth on private interfaces will not be metered and therefore does not count toward your per slice transfer limits. We hope this makes life a bit easier for our larger customers using several slices with lots of chatter. Private IPs can be obtained by opening a support issue and there is no charge. We’re looking forward to everyone’s feedback!
