If you ever wanted to prove your geek-cred to your friends what could be better than using your iPhone as a graphical remote for your car stereo.

Nels Johnson has done exactly that, and has posted the details for how to do it yourself at his site http://www.quickanddirty.tv/. 

Weâ€™d point out that you should probably have someone else controlling the tunes, whilst you pay attention to the road!
