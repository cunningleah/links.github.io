We've covered this year's Macheist a couple of times already, but they hit a milestone today and all the software, including heavy hitters CSSedit, Snapz Pro, and Pixelmator, is now unlocked. Whatever else you might think of the concept, it's a mighty good deal for all this software. I just purchased it myself and received the serial numbers immediately (excepting Cha-Ching which will shortly release a new version with new serials).
