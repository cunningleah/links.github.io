Youll either think this is lame (not target market) or so cool youve wet your pants (target market) and act accordingly. The first attempt at the model by Valleyschwag didnt scale and folded. Startup Schwag isnt relying on the companies to produce the stuff, though (thats where Valleyschwag ran into trouble when they got too big), they do it themselves with the companys permission.
