Recently my wife (the proud owner of a new MacBook she procured over Christmas) tasked me with the job of finding her a recipe manager for OS X.  Her only pre-requisites were that it had to be cheap, easy to use, and not something that would slow her down.  After a couple cups of coffee, and some plowing around on Google I managed to find something that fits right in with her give it to me free ethos - Measuring Cup by Shallot Patch.
