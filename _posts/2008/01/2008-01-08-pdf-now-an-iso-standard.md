Stephen Partridge, the business development Manager for Acrobat has announced on his Adobe Blog that the International Organization for Standardisation (ISO) voted to approve Adobes PDF as an international document format standard. The ISO standard number is ISO32000.

This means that as an ISO standard, Adobe will no longer have sole control over what is already the de facto standard for creating, editing, sharing and commenting on documents between multiple platforms. Adobe will be just one of many implementers of that standard. Adobe expects to participate on the ISO committees determining changes that should be included in a revised standard, said James King, a senior principle scientist and PDF architect at Adobe.
