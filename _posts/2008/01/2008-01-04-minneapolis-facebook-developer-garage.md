A quick note for anyone in the Twin Cities and interested in the Facebook craze: Slantwise and Best Buy are sponsoring a developer garage here on January 15th.



Members from Facebooks platform team will be giving an overview of Facebooks application ecosystem and providing a few tips on best practices for developing applications. Local developers will also be showing off their latest creations.
