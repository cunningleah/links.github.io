MacHeist II is shaping into another really great success this time around as they quickly approach their target of $100,000 for charity. The screenshot and video capture utility Snapz Pro X (a $69 program) was just recently added to the bundle, which seemed to cause a flurry of purchases.  I think in the next 24 hours or sooner we should see the bundle fully unlocked and Pixelmator also added to the package.  

Update:  The recently released image editing app Pixelmator has also just been added to the bundle, making it an extremely attractive offering at only $49.  Also a portion of the money collected is going to several worthy charities.

Below is a list of what is included for those who dont know.  Check out Marvins MacHeist II software round-up for more details on each program.

1password - A really useful password manager.
CoverSurta - The popular iTunes controller app.
Cha-Ching - A great money and finances manager.
iStopMotion - Stop motion photography application.
Awaken - A really nice alarm clock app.
Speed Download - A Mac download manager.
AppZapper - The Macs missing application uninstaller .
TaskPaper - A to do list manager.
CSSEdit - The best CCS editor for Mac.
Snapz Pro X - A screenshot and video capture utility.
Pixelmator - image editor (just added!)
