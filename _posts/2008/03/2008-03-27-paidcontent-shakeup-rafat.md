LA-based blog PaidContent.org is hiring a Dow Jones and Yahoo Finance veteran, Nathan Richardson, as CEO, Valleywag says.  The company is also said to be adding a sales manager.  Founder Rafat Ali will focus on editorial.

It is not yet known whether the PaidContent management shakeup is a planned evolution--or whether Rafat was defenestrated.   ; )

*UPDATE: This post was intended to be tongue in cheek, but as a commenters noted, the first version came out snarky.  Apologies!  Truth be told, we think this is a smart move by PaidContent. Rafat is the company's strongest editor/writer, and every minute he spends on business is a minute lost to writing, researching, etc. TechCrunch made the same move quite successfully last year, and we expect a lot of growing blog networks will follow suit.
