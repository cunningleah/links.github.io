I am getting ready to pack and head to Las Vegas in the morning for Mix 08. This year, while I am very interested to learn about all the new stuff that will get announced, meet some new people and see some familiar faces, there is another thing I am very interested to see play out, Mix + Twitter.



In the past, someone would have created a big list of RSS feeds and allowed everyone to subscribe. However, via Twitter and Hashtags I think there is a better option for keeping up with what's going on at the conference this year.


Hashtags are a community-driven convention for adding additional context and metadata to your tweets. They're like tags on Flickr, only added inline to your post. You create a hashtag simply by prefixing a word with a hash symbol: #hashtag. [Twitter Wiki]

To enable hashtags on your account, you need to follow the http://twitter.com/hashtags twitter bot. Once you are have done that, just include #mix #Mix08 anywhere in your tweet and it will show up on the following page http://hashtags.org/tag/mix08/.


And of course, feel free to follow me.


Update: It looks like folks are using the tag #Mix08 instead of #mix..
