Though many would have you believe that white people come of age at Summer Camp, it’s simply not the truth.  Immediately following graduation but prior to renovating a house, white people take their first step from childhood to maturity by hosting a successful dinner party.

It is imperative that white people know how to host a good dinner party as they will be expected to do it well into retirement.

At the most basic level, these simple gatherings involve 3-6 couples getting together at a single house or apartment, having dinner and talking for 5-6 hours. Though it might seem basic these events are some of the most stressful situations in all of white culture.

Hosts are expected to deliver a magical evening. The food must be home made with fresh, organic ingredients, the music must be just right (ambient, new, but not too loud), and the decorations inside the house should be subtle but elegant.  The ultimate goal is to do a better job than the couple at the last dinner party while attempting to make everyone jealous and sort of dislike you.

The dinner party is the opportunity for white people to be judged on their taste in food, wine, furniture, art, interior design, music, and books.   Outside of dictatorships and a few murder trials, there might not be a more rigorous judgment process in the modern world.  Everything must be perfect.  One copy of US Weekly, a McDonalds wrapper, a book by John Grisham, a Third Eye Blind CD, or an Old School DVD can undo months and maybe even years of work.

Even before guests arrive the pressure on the host is immense and it does not let up once people begin to arrive.  While eating, drinking, and conversation are expected to fill up 5-6 hours, sometimes it’s just not enough.  In order to fill the silence, white people will often turn to board games (Cranium!) or Wii Bowling.  This lets everyone have fun together without having to really talk to each other, which is usually more fun anyways.

It is strongly encouraged to bring a gift to these dinner parties, usually either wine or some kind of dessert.  If you are able to bring a particularly rare dish from your culture, you will be the star of the party.  To seal the deal, be sure to explain as much as you possibly can about the dish: history, availability, and the proper way to eat it.  Every white person at the party will be taking mental notes and will be in your debt for introducing them to something new and authentic.  If a white person says they have eaten the dish before, it is best to respond by saying “you ate a watered down version.  They don’t even sell this to white people, it’s that intense. Even I had to show ID.”

The entire party will universally acknowledge you as the top guests, even the hosts will appreciate you for bringing diversity to the table in both food and person form.
