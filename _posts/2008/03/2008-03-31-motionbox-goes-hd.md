Video-sharing and storage site Motionbox is now offering some users an HD option. The NY-based service's premium members, who pay $30 a year, will be able to upload and play HD videos; the company promises that the site's free users will also see a noticable upgrade in the quality of their standard-def videos.

We don't think conventional video-sharing sites like YouTube and the YouTube-wannabees need to offer HD, but this makes sense for Motionbox: It's targeting users who are shooting home movies and the like with "near-HD" cameras, and want a place to share those clips with a handful of their friends and family.

Gearhead details from the release:

The HD player takes full advantage of Adobe Flash Player's capabilities and the exceptional H.264 video format. Major advances to Motionbox's server-based video rendering engine enable Web-based editing of full 1080p video, with AVCHD support coming soon.
