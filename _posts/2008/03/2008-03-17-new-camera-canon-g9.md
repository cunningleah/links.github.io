Boulder Creek

Got a new camera as a carry-around daily shooter, a Canon Powershot G9.  Great specs for a (fairly) compact camera, with some important features for photo geeks, notably the ability to shoot raw.  It feels great in the hand, very solid, and the manual features are easy to get at and reasonable to use.  Yes, we’d all prefer knurled rings on the lens barrel for aperture and shutter speed setting, but let’s all repeat together: “Canon is not Leica”.

The only real quibble I have with this camera is the sensor.  At 12 megapixels, it’s way too much resolution, especially for a small sensor type like this.  I’d much rather have purchased this camera with an eight megapixel sensor and gotten even lower noise at higher ISO ratings.  When you’re talking about the consumer space like this, the main thing that more megapixels buys you is more noise in the image, more disk space taken up on your computer, and longer transfer and processing times.

That said it’s a minor quibble, as it achieves very low noise even at reasonably high ISO, and the extreme ISO settings (800 and above) I’d go so far as to call usable in a pinch. The image above is a shot of Boulder Creek I took this morning before heading in to work.  We got a nice little snowfall last night to remind us that spring is not here yet, and in fact March is the snowiest month of the year usually.
