"Without change something sleeps inside us, and seldom awakens." That's one of my favorite lines and certainly applicable to my situation.  It's hard to believe that I've been at MarketWatch.com for almost 8 months!  What a ride it’s been…and well worth it I’d say. I’ve made the leap from not only a new company but an entirely new industry. From Healthcare to Financial News is quite a change I’d say. 
But this hasn’t only been a big change for me, but for MarketWatch as well. The past few months have seen big changes, both the assimilation by a new company (News Corp) and the departure of our CTO (Jamie Thingelstad).  Nothing startling has happened to MarketWatch yet, but I’m sure there’s exciting changes on the Horizon.
It’s funny how being complacent stunts growth. I think I’ve grown more over the past 8 months than I have in my entire life. 
Maybe the same is in store for MarketWatch...
