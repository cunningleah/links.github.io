It is still all free!

Quotes Attributable to Brent Halliburton
Cogmaps initial release changed the way that business development, sales, and recruiters used the Internet.  With the new private mapping features, they can take all of their knowledge online and create social networks around their proprietary data.

Cogmap is the wikipedia of organization charts, bringing information about how the hierarchy of organizations works to the masses.

Originally, Cogmap was built to allow people to share information and benefit from the power of a wiki, but feedback from the cogmunity was that some information needed to be protected.  With private maps, all of the information you add will only be shared with your social network.

Private maps allow a network of people to share organizational data among themselves, empowering organizations to share their knowledge quickly and easily.

Coglinks make map information embeddable, extending Cogmaps value out into the blogosphere.
