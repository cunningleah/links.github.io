The new Dow Jones (NYSE: NWS) CEO Les Hinton gave his first public interview to The Australian, and though no revelatory points, some reiteration of current policies, and a hint that various DJ units would be working more closely together with News Corp in the near future.



On WSJ and News Corp working together: "One option is moving the WSJ and a large number of the Dow Jones Newswires people into (News Corp's headquarters in) midtown Manhattan...We haven't made a final determination on it, but it is a way of getting them alltogether."



On WSJ.com's business models, it looks like it will remain subscription for most part, as has been mentioned by Murdoch before, with some free parts. He said the premium revenues, in "ten of millions" of dollars, was too hard to give up. Also, on the traffic side, "In January and February we had over 23 million unique visitors to the site...a40 per cent increase year-on-year in actual audience".
