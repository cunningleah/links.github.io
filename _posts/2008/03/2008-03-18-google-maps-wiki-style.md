Google is getting more comfortable with its inner wiki. It is now allowing anyone in the U.S., Australia, or New Zealand to improve Google Maps by editing places for everyone else to see. So if a restaurant listed on a map of your local neighborhood has closed or moved, you can correct the map. You can also add your own places. It was possible previously to edit your own maps, but now Google Maps will take the edits and let everyone benefit who subsequently looks at it. Google Maps should get really detailed now. It is not clear, though, how disputes will be handled.
