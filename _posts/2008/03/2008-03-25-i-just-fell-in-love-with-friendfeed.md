Several days ago, I whipped off a quick list of feature requests for FriendFeed which I published on this blog. First, I got a comment from Bret Taylor, one of the founders. He said they had passed the list around the company and agreed with them. Cool. Then yesterday they launched one of them, posting an @reply to twitter from friendfeed.
