Jason Calacanis wants you to save money for your startup, so he has come up with 17 tips on how. The intention is good. Working lean is great and means you probably wont need outside money. And theres some good stuff, like dont buy Microsoft Office and skip the phone system. But theres also some depressing bullshit like:



Fire people who are not workaholics. come on folks, this is startup life, its not a game. go work at the post office or stabucks if you want balance in your life. For realz

Heres another take on that: Fire the people who are workaholics! Heres five reasons why:



Workaholics may well say that they enjoy those 14 hour days week after week, but despite their claims, working like that all month, all the time is not going to be sustainable. When the burnout crash comes, and it will, itll hit all the harder and according to Murphy at the least convenient time.
People who are workaholics are likely to attempt to fix problems by throwing sheer hours at the problem. If youre dealing with people working with anything creatively thats a deadbeat way to get great work done.
People who always work late makes the people who dont feel inadequate for merely working reasonable hours. Thatll lead to guilt, misery, and poor morale. Worse, itll lead to ass-in-seat mentality where people will stay late out of obligation, but not really be productive.
If all you do is work, your value judgements are unlikely to be sound. Making good calls on is it worth it? is absolutely critical to great work. Missing out on life in general to put more hours in at the office screams misguided values.
Working with interesting people is more interesting than just working. If all you got going for your life is work, work, work, the good team-gelling lunches are going to be some pretty boring straight shop talk. Yawn. Id much rather hear more about your whittling project, your last trek, how your garden is doing, or when youll get your flight certificate.

If your start-up can only succeed by being a sweatshop, your idea is simply not good enough. Go back to the drawing board and come up with something better that can be implemented by whole people, not cogs.



Update: Calacanis reeled it in and reconsidered, sorta. Requiring passion is certainly something we hopefully can all rally about.
