Finally, one reason to care about CNBC on the Web: real-time NASDAQ stock quotes. The network has started providing real-time quotes by subscribing to a new service from NASDAQ, "Nasdaq Last Sale," launched this morning. CNBC has long had real-time stock quotes on TV, but quotes were delayed 20 minutes on the Web, as they are on most free Web sites. CNBC says they'll also provide the quotes on its service for mobile phones.
