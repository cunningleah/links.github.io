Technorati, the once-promising, but has-been blog search engine, has raised $7.5 million of a $10 million Series D round, PE Hub reports, citing a regulatory filing. Returning to invest more: Draper Fisher Jurvetson, Mobius Venture Capital, and FG Incubation, which runs Technorati Japan. Technorati has raised $30 million to date, according to PE Hub.
