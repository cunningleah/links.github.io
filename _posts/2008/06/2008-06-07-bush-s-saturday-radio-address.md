Congress will soon vote on legislation to fund our troops serving on the front lines of the war on terror.
...there is no reason for further delay...the bill must not exceed the reasonable and responsible funding levels I have requested... the time has come for them to support our troops in harm's way...Our men and women in uniform and their families deserve better than this...our troops are taking on dangerous missions with skill and determination...the men and women of our Armed Forces risk their lives to make sure their fellow citizens are safer...They've earned the respect of all Americans...Congress should pass a responsible funding bill that gives our men and women in uniform the resources they need -- and the support they have earned.
