I don't post as much about music and digital technology as I used to. I have come to the conclusion that most artists and their managers get it these days. And the ones who don't are a lost cause. So better to move on and start thinking and writing about something else.


But this post by Bob Lefsetz on AC/DC doing an exclusive deal with Wal-Mart was too good to pass up. Here are some choice lines by Bob on the subject:
To limit AC/DC sales exclusively to Wal-Mart is akin to limiting bubblegum sales to Tiffany.
and
AC/DC is the biggest band still alive in the minds of teenagers.
and
But AC/DC cares not a whit about all this, about the new generation.
Its like theyre having a fire sale, trying to get everybodys dough
one last time. They dont understand what they MEAN TO PEOPLE!
and
What kind of crazy fucked up world do we live in where a band wont let
its fans buy its record? One where the only thing that matters is
money? Where music takes not even a back seat, but rides in the trunk?
and
The closest Wal-Mart to me is almost twenty miles away! Assuming
theres no traffic, thats an eight dollar fuel surcharge on the disc.
But at least Ive got wheels Kids, home from school, music addicts,
but without their drivers licenses, are inured to getting their music
online. And if you wont sell it track by track, theyll steal it that
way. If you dont know this, youre still living in the twentieth
century, still waiting for Napster to come along and blow your mind.

My son Josh loves AC/DC but if it's not on iTunes, it's not going to get on his iPod. Clearly AC/DC and/or their manager is in the category of clueless.
