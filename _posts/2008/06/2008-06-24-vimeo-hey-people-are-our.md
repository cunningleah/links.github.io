Last month Barry Diller told investors that things were going swimingly at Vimeo, IAC's little video-sharing site. Not swimingly enough to consititute a real business -- the service is generating next to no revenues, Barry said -- but still, he was fond of it. He sort of talked about it as if it was a pet.

Here's another head pat for the service, from one of its employees. Vimeo's Andrew Pile notes that this week Vimeo served up more than 1 million videos in a single day - a 5x increase from its average a year ago. How to keep that going? More videos from Matthew Harding, who apparently generated about 25% of Vimeo's traffic that day with this video, which is indeed worth watching.
