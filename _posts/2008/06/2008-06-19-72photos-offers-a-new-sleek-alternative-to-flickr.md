For those that are hedging their bets by setting up shop elsewhere, the photo sharing web site called 72Photos is hoping to attract their interest by creating the next gen flickr. The site isn't brand-new, but they've been adding and perfecting their feature set since their initial launch last year when they were known as "XMG Image."
