There is nothing better than sharing the joy of a Steve Jobs Keynote with fellow Apple fans. That's why several of TUAW's bloggers (myself included) are hanging out in the tuawrocks room in IRC (the server is: irc.freenode.net, channel is 'tuawrocks'). Join us to chat about what we hope to see, the live coverage, and the aftermath.If you're looking for a good OS X IRC client give Colloquy a try.Permalink
