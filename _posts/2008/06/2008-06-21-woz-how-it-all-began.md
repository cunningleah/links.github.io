Filed under: The Woz
Steve Wozniak, co-founder of Apple and inventor of the Apple I and II, talks with the BBC about starting Apple in 1976. "Everything was ... thinking about the good of humanity," he said. His starting salary? $24,000 a year: maybe a quarter of what an Apple engineer makes today. 

For those of you new to the Apple universe, this is an entertaining 10-minute brief of how it all began. 

Woz has probably told this story a million times, but he talks about it with the same enthusiasm as if it happened yesterday. He discusses the Silicon Valley homebrew movement, Microsoft, and the perceived animosity between Bill Gates and Steve Jobs.

Also -- and totally off-topic -- Woz wears a giant watch. I mean, seriously. Huge.
