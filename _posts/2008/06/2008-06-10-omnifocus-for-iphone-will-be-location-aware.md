 Guy-I-wish-was-my-friend Merlin Mann writes at 43 Folders about OmniFocus for iPhone, a project he's involved with. Perhaps the most exciting new feature is the fact that OmniFocus will be location-aware.
 OmniGroup says that by "using your location, OmniFocus can create a custom list of actions to complete nearby. Buying groceries? OmniFocus can show you the closest grocery store and create an instant shopping list."
 Pretty sweet. OmniGroup expects that OmniFocus for iPhone will be available via the App Store around the launch date in early July.
