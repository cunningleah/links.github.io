The facelift continues! Pickled Onion rolled out newly designed versions of his world famous articles site and our network status page. We think you’ll find them more inline with the main site’s look and feel.



In the last podcast, we mentioned our new office and getting some pictures online. Shame on me for taking so long, but we now have a Slicehost Flickr account with a sampling of our new digs. It’s not quite finished, but we’re getting there!
