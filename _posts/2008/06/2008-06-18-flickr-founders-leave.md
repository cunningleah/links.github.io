Flickr, one of the few acquisitions that Yahoo (NSDQ: YHOO) has not messed up, at least on the product side, is now seeing the two co-founders leave: the husband-and-wife team of Stewart Butterfield and Caterina Fake are leaving the company, joining the mass exec exodus happening at the beleaguered company, reports TC. Fake left last Friday, while Butterfield will leave on July 12. Kakul Srivastava, the director of product management for Flickr, will take over Stewart's role as GM of Flickr. The two were driving a lot of product innovation within the company and Fake was leading the community/social tools development at Yahoo...then again, they lasted much longer that many other founders brought in by Yahoo, or even Google.
