Ok, Ive been ridiculously hard on Hulu from the beginning. But that ends. Today. 

Because Hulu is now streaming full episodes of The Daily Show With Jon Stewart and The Colbert Report, from Comedy Central. No more Tivo. No more dealing with BitTorrent. I can just log in and watch the show in 480p, and that makes me very, very happy.

I will never again refer to Hulu as Clown Co. Or mention that Hulu means cease & desist in Swahili. And I will stop making fun of them for stealing Googles mission statement and planning to sell panty hose.

Hell, Ill even let the occasional puff piece in Fortune go by without comment.

Hulu is also adding a few shows from PBS later this month, including NOVA, Carrier, Scientific American Frontiers, and Wired Science. Frankly, I couldnt care less. Ill be watching the Daily Show.
