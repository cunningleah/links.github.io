Dow Jones gets about half of its revenues from its digital operations right now, and within a few short years, News Corp (NYSE: NWS). CEO Rupert Murdoch expects his subsidiary to receive 75 percent of its revs from its online business. Reuters reported Murdoch's remarks from the Cannes Lions 2008 international advertising festival, where he was joined by News Corp. COO Peter Chernin. He added that he wasn't solely referring to The Wall St. Journal, but the other DJ properties, which include its Newswires as well as financial pubs like Barron's and Marketwatch. Asked about what's surprised him since taking over the company last fall, Murdoch said he didn't expect "how cooperative the vast majority of journalists have been."
