Favicons, those 16X16 ico files which represent a particular URL have been known to be pretty, but there are some favicons out on the web that are just plain awful. Despite their size, a good favicon helps out your readers in a number of ways. For instance, if you use FireFox and have a number of tabs opened, each tab displays the favicon of the website that tab has loaded. Also, a favicon that has been aesthetically designed will give your site a better chance of being seen when mixed in with a ton of other websites. Not to mention, a great favicon would inspire other designers as well as possibly having your site featured in a post which discussed the best designed icons.
