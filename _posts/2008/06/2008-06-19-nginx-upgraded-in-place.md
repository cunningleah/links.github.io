NginX 0.7.2 is now available. I was running an ancient version, 0.7.1 (just kidding).  

So, I downloaded and built 0.7.2. Then I followed the instructions at the bottom of this page, which explain how to upgrade on the fly. Itâ€™s even cooler than just not losing any ongoing connections (which would be cool enough!). It also can be rolled back just as easily, if the new server proves to be faulty.

This is just too cool! Anyway, welcome NginX 0.7.2, RIP NginX 0.7.1.
