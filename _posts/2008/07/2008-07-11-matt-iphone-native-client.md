We’re doing an iPhone-native WordPress client, check out the screencast here. It will work for both .com and .org, be available FREE from the App Store, and best of all it’s going to be completely Open Source, which
as far as I know no current apps in the store are. Update: Good news, sounds like there will be at least a few OS apps in the store on opening days.
