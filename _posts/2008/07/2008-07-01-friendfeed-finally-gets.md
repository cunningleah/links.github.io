FriendFeed, the popular social network feed aggregator, has released a new version of its site that has been optimized for the iPhone.  While FriendFeed has always featured a relatively spartan design, the standard version sports small fonts that make text difficult to read on the iPhones screen.  The new version has increased the font size, and has further tweaked link placement and picture sizes to make the site more accessible to mobile users.

The site also includes a new Post photos from your phone link that will let users submit photos to FriendFeed straight from their iPhone.  Each user is assigned a unique email address (something like jason+nota483realone@mail2ff.com).  To submit a picture, users simply send photos chosen from the iPhones integrated photo viewer to the assigned address.  The feature works well, but youll need to manually enter the obfuscated email address - there doesnt seem to be an easy way to save it to your address book.
