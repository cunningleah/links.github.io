CentralStandardTech, a site tended by Minnesota geek Luke Francl (yes, that Luke from Minnebar and Minnedemo fame), is one I frequent to stay appraised of all things tech in our State and is in my #1 folder of feeds in my RSS reader.

From a great tech blogroll to a calendar of events and, especially, an aggregation of posts from those blogs, its a site you should frequent if youre interested in technology in Minnesota and the people here with propellers on their beanies building great software and leveraging web and internet innovation trends.

Much to my delight today, I discovered a new forum by Jamie Thinglestad (former CTO of The Wall Street Journal Digital Network) called MinneLightroom. If youre not an Adobe Lightroom fan like I am then this is of little interest to you, but there are a couple of things of note:

1) Adobe Lightroom is developed right here in Minnesota at the Adobe engineering office in Arden Hills

2) Jamie is using the WordPress bbpress forum software  one Im interested in but find far too limiting currently  but he was able to get this forum up-n-running quickly for a narrow audience of Minnesota Lightroom fans. Granted, hes pretty adept at WordPress (as evidenced by his session on optimizing it at the recent MinneBar), but deploying this forum has created a focal point in MN for interested Lightroom users and is there if youre interested in joining.

I encourage you to head over to CentralStandardTech right now and just poke around. If youre interested in Minnesota tech happenings and the people involved in it here, itll be your hub.
