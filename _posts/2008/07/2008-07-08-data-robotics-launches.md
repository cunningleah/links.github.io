Award-Winning Drobo Adds FireWire 800 and Dramatically Improved USB 2.0 Performance 

Press Release: Mountain View, CA – July 8, 2008 ˆ–Today Data Robotics launched the second generation of its award-winning Drobo product. Featuring FireWire 800 alongside improved USB 2.0 performance and an upgraded core processor, the new Drobo is the fastest product in its class for managing and storing digital information.

The increased read and write performance now makes the product ideal for use as primary storage for media applications such as photography and video editing, as well as secondary storage.

“Years ago Data Robotics set out on a mission: To create a set of technologies that allows storage to be safe, expandable and incredibly simple. Our customers have been asking for a high-performance FireWire connection since we launched Drobo last year, and this new release is the next logical step in providing users with what they need ˆ and have come to expect ˆ in the Drobo product,” said Geoff Barrall, CEO and founder of Data Robotics. 

The second generation Drobo incorporates all of the features and functionality that consumers have grown to know and love in its predecessor: Unparalleled ease of use, redundant data protection, and instant expandability that allows storage capacity to grow with users over time. New enhancements include an upgraded core processor, two FireWire 800 ports, dramatically increased USB 2.0 performance, and newly optimized firmware. This release addresses the needs of any user seeking a reliable method of managing vast amounts of data without sacrificing performance; from video editors, to heavy down-loaders, to photographers who shoot raw images.

“Our ability to deliver FireWire 800 in the newest version of Drobo gives us even more of an edge with two particular groups: Creative professionals who rely on the speed and performance of their equipment in their day to day work, and the Apple community which has a strong affinity for FireWire products,” adds Barrall.

“When it comes to video editing, the faster the storage, the better, and this is where the new Drobo with FireWire 800 really shines,” said Andy Hirsch of Blue Moon Productions. “I had previously used Drobo as a backup solution for Final Cut Pro, but the enhanced performance of the second generation Drobo has allowed me to use it as my primary storage drive for video editing.”

Features include:

 


Best in class performance
Redundant data protection
Hot expansion up to 16TB
Ability to take advantage of mix and match drive capacities
Two FireWire 800 ports (FireWire 400 compatible)
One USB 2.0 port
