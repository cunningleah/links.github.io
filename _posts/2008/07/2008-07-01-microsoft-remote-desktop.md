This is news that is certain to make Mac based Windows Admins (of which I am one) very happy: Microsoft Remote Desktop Connection 2 is finally out of beta. The final release includes all the new features that Microsoft added, some of the highlights include:

    The ability to open multiple instances of Remote Desktop without resorting to a hack (though I do believe that each connection spawns a new instance of the app itself).
    Redesigned UI
    Support for Network Level Authentication (which makes connections more secure)

You can get more info about this release from the MacBU blog post. Microsoft Remote Desktop Connection 2 is free, and a Universal app. And as always, I would be remiss if I didn't mention the very capable CoRD, which is an open source replacement for Microsoft's tool.Read
