A great huzzah! was heard through the land. Apple today announced that they will be lifting the NDA on the iPhone SDK. This is incredibly good news, as it means that, once lifted, developers will be able to talk with each other about the iPhone. And, among those developers are those that have created iPhone content for our Core Animation and iPhone SDK Development Books, a screencast series on iPhone development, and a brand new Pragmatic Studio on iPhone Development. All of these have been sitting here, waiting to get released.


So, all day I've been getting calls and e-mails saying “The NDA is lifted. Where are the books?” The answer is simple: right now the NDA hasn't been lifted. Apple have announced that they will be dropping it, and that a new developer agreement will be sent out within "a week or so." Our developers are still apparently bound by the existing NDA.


So, I spoke with someone senior at Apple this morning, and I'm waiting to hear back. In effect, the NDA is dead. But I need to protect our authors, so we can't release any iPhone content until we hear back that they're out of danger.


I'll blog here when I know more. We'll also send out an e-mail to our announcement mailing list and RSS feed.


Interesting times...
