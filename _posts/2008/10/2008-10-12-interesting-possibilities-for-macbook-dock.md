As you can see from the Chinese spy shots below, the new MacBooks will have all I/O ports on the left and optical drive on the right. While this seems somewhat trivial, it does enable one of the more interesting patents of recent memory to become a reality.  The 'iMac dock'.   It is also interesting to note that the ports generally line up between the smaller and large laptops. Will we see a dock on Tuesday?
