As you can see from the Chinese spy shots below, the new MacBooks will have all I/O ports on the left and optical drive on the right.  While this seems somewhat trivial, it does enable one of the more interesting patents of recent memory to become a reality. 

The 'iMac dock'.  

It is also interesting to note that the ports generally line up between the smaller and large laptops.  Will we see a dock on Tuesday?   



Thanks to Gizmodo for for the mockup
