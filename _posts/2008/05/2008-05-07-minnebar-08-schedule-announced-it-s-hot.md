The program for our annual Minnesota Barcamp -- Minnebar -- was just released late yesterday. The event is being held Saturday, May 10, at the Coffman Union on the U of MN campus. Here's a look at where things are so far, and note that it's subject to change.



Don't miss the panel at 12:00 noon: "State of the State: Technology in Minnesota" in the theater on the first floor. Panelists include: Doug Olson, who heads a Microsoft developer team in MN  Jamie Thinglestad, Mpls-based CTO of Dow Jones Online  Michael Gorman, Partner at VC firm Split Rock Partners Robert Stephens, founder of Geek Squad (a unit of Best Buy) And Dan Grigsby, our infamous local rabble rouser at Unpossible.com :-) and original lead organizer of Minnebar/Minnedemo.Note the "Lightning Demos" at 4:00 and 5:00 -- which I think will be especially good! These are five-minute presentations available to new or existing startups, or anyone who has a new idea or favorite topic to talk about. If you want to add yours to the list (which is not yet published), just send an email to event co-orgnanizer Luke Francl at look (at) recursion (dot) org -- telling him your name, company name, and what you'll be talking about. 



See you Saturday! This will be fun -- how could it not be, with a frenzied crowd of some 400 of your fellow MN tech enthusiasts? :-)


I'll be there Twittering and shootin' pix all over. And I'm also part of the Minnov8 team, who'll be Twittering as well. But, trust me, there'll be plenty of hot networking in between!
