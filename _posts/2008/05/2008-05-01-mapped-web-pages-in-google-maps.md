Posted by Abe Murray, Product ManagerYou may have noticed Google's experimental views for search results introduced the ability to view web pages on a map.  We've been having fun enabling this feature for Google Maps.We're excited about this because it helps us give you search results for more types of Maps searches.  A search for Einstein highlights important locations from Einstein's life with links to web pages with more information.  Mapping these locations can help you understand web searches from a new perspective.  This is one of many steps we are taking to help deliver on the geoweb.Check this feature out - go to Google Maps, click on the "Show search options" link near the search box, and select "Mapped web pages" from the drop-down menu that appears. This early release works best for English queries in USA. Try out some queries - our favorites include ufo sightings and math conferences in California.
