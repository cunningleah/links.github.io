I’m pleased to share that I’ve been selected as a recipient of the Business Journal’s “40 Under 40″ award. 

My heartfelt thanks to all of you who supported my nomination, especially to Lars Leafblad (a ‘07 award recipient himself) for thinking of me in the first place.  

I’m honored, and in good company:  Jamie Thingelstad’s a winner this year too.

Finally, thanks to Graeme Thickins for the kind quote featured in the article.
