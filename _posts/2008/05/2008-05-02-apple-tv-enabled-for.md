It's been a long time coming but the feature you'd been requesting for is here.


Apple TV is now enabled to allow movie purchases.  No longer do you have to buy movies via iTunes then sync to your Apple TV.  You can now do this directly on your favorite device.  As far as pricing goes, new releases will be available for $14.99 and older titles for $9.99.  Sadly, you still can't buy HD titles.  I'll say give it a few more months. 


The news came on the same day as the announcement that new movies can now be purchased on iTunes the same day as the DVD release (http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2008/05/01itunes.html) .  So now there's absolutely no reason to go down to the video store to buy DVDs.  Just turn on your Apple TV and your purchases are just a few clicks away.  Can it get any better than this?
