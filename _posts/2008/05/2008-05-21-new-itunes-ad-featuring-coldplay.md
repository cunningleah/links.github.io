Filed under: iTS, iTunes, Apple  Last night, Apple released a new ad for iTunes featuring Coldplay. This ad takes the silhouette ads to the max with a beautiful Leopard/space-esqe background and Coldplay singing their new song, Viva la Vida. Once again, this ad was featured during an episode of American Idol, which seems to have been a weekly occurrence through the Idol season. You can see this video by going to Apple's iPod + iTunes site and scrolling to the bottom of the page and clicking "Watch the new TV ad," or you can use the direct link (.mov link). Thanks for the tip, Kevin!Read
