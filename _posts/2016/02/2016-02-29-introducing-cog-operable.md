First, we wanted to remove some of the concerns that kept teams from adopting ChatOps. We often heard that companies were uncomfortable with the security ramifications of ChatOps, so we built a fine grained access control mechanism to let you automate even mission critical workflows in chat, with complete control over who can run them and exactly what arguments they can pass to them. We added an audit logging facility so that you can keep track of all the actions that are performed on Cog, and who performed them.
