With the recent release of Amazon API Gateway, developers can now create custom RESTful APIs that trigger AWS Lambda functions, allowing for truly serverless backends that include built-in authorization, traffic management, monitoring, and analytics. To showcase what’s possible with this new integration and just how easy it is to build a service that runs entirely without servers, we’ve built SquirrelBin, a simple website that allows users to CRUD runnable little nuggets of code called acorns.
