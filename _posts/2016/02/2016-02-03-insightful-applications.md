In previous posts, I wrote about the need for insight generation and provided an example of an insightful application. I maintain that insightful applications are the key to businesses effectively exploiting big data in order to improve decision-making and address important problems. To better understand and appreciate the need for developing such applications, it is important to consider what is happening more broadly in big data and evaluate how our experiences with business intelligence systems should be driving our thinking about insightful applications.
