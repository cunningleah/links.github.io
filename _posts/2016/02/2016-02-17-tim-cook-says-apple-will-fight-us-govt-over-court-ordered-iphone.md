Apple chief Tim Cook has attacked the recent court order that compels Apple to unlock and decrypt the San Bernardino gunman's iPhone. "Opposing this order is not something we take lightly. We feel we must speak up in the face of what we see as an overreach by the US government," says an open letter published by Cook early this morning.
