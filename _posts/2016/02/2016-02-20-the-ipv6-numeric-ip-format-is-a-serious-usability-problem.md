Unfortunately our IPv6 advocacy has largely fallen on deaf ears. We show our customers the benefits of IPv6 both on private networks and globally and they nod and smile and then go back to using IPv4. After a few private conversations with customers and also after reflecting upon our own IPv6 experience, I think I understand the reason. A theme that keeps coming up over and over again is the inconvenience of IPv6 for admins and developers, and the IP format seems to be the top complaint.
