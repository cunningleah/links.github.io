One convenient way to run microservices is to deploy them as Docker containers. Docker containers are quick to provision, easily portable, and provide process isolation. Amazon EC2 Container Service (Amazon ECS) provides a highly scalable, high performance container management service. This service supports Docker containers and enables you to easily run microservices on a managed cluster of Amazon EC2 instances.
