Before he started working here two years ago, Tony Odufuye was very familiar with SPS Commerce and many of the people in the company. That’s because Tony’s wife, Linda, had already been working here for a few years. As he got to know some of Linda’s work friends, they recommended he join them at one of Minnesota’s fastest-growing tech companies.
