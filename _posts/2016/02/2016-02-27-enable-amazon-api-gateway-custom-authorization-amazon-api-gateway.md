With Amazon API Gateway custom authorization, you can control access to your APIs using bearer token authentication strategies, such as OAuth or SAML. To do so, you provide and configure a custom authorizer, a Lambda function you own, for API Gateway to use to authorize the client requests for the configured APIs.
