Certainly the major providers offer some type of “service health dashboard” that will tell you whether they think they’re seeing an outage. But there’s been some debate as to whether collaboration vendors’ reported uptime jives with reality. You might think you could rely instead on public services like www.isitdownrightnow.com or www.downdetector.com, but their measurements are made from their offices or datacenters – not yours. And they don’t provide any detail around what isn’t working: is it just the website? Or is their SMTP service degraded such that you can’t send outgoing messages? Or maybe their message store is down? Or maybe their public SMTP service is down, so they’re not receiving messages from external services. It’s hard to know.
