I’ve curated what I consider some of the more useful pieces on DevOps (with a bit of Agile and Cloud mixed in) that I’ve read this year. It tilts towards the cultural aspect of DevOps transformation as I think that’s the harder part. There’s so much great content out there; please add any of your favorites in the comments!
