Salesforce Marketing Cloud is a digital marketing hub that makes it possible for marketers to plan, personalize and optimize 1-to-1 customer journeys across multiple channels. It brings together all the things that matter to marketers â€“ a complete view of the customer, content, personalization, all digital marketing channels (email, mobile, web, apps, social, advertising) and the power of the customer journey. By nurturing customers through triggered and automated journeys as well as collecting data to develop more personalized future campaigns, retailers can engage customers in a smarter way and predict their likelihood to take specific actions.
