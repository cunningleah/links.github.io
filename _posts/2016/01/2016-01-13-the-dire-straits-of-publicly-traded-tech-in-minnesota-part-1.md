What little positive there was in 2015 goes to B2B omnichannel retail software maker SPS Commerce who was the biggest winner in calendar year 2015, growing by 35% from $909,150,000 to $1,233,000,000 â€” no small feat. The next closest was IoT firm Digi International, which realized a 29% gain from $223,500,000 to $287,910,000, also great to see.
