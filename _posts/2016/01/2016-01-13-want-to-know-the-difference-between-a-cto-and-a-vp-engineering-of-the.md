Because more technology people probably read startup blogs I’m guessing this post will come under more scrutiny.  The terms “CTO” and “VP Engineering” have such stigmas associated with what they are that I’m sure some people will feel uncomfortable with the definitions I’ve put forward.  Still, I believe I’m offering an accurate representation of the ideal configuration of the main technology leaders.
