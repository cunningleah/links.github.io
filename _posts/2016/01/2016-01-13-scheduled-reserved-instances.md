Our new Scheduled Reserved Instances are a great fit for use cases of this type (and many more). They allow you to reserve capacity on a recurring basis with a daily, weekly, or monthly schedule over the course of a one-year term. After you complete your purchase, the instances are available to launch during the time windows that you specified.
