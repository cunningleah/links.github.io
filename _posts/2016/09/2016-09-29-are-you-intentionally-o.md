I've worked to be purposeful in my communication and to align that with our goals. Being deliberate in designing your working relationships as this article suggests is very important.

> Effective relationship design is a two-way conversation. You cannot simply impose a dynamic, innovative environment by ordering people to “be creative” or “collaborate.” Creating the conditions in which creativity and collaboration are emergent properties of the larger system, the organization’s culture, is as much a result of your behavior as the rules you set. It is the encouragement you give as much as the discipline you enforce.

This, along with deliberate management of your calendar, are key elements to success. Thanks to [Leah](https://twitter.com/cunningleah) for the link! 👏
