Mesosphere Enterprise DC/OS 1.7 is now generally available and introduces new features across the board. They include support for integrated service discovery, distributed load balancing mechanisms, and the ability to run stateful services using persistent local and external storage volumes. These included containerized stateful services such as MySQL as well as distributed stateful services such as Cassandra.
