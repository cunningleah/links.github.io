Like so many of us, I have a love-hate relationship with the alarm clock on my phone. I often hate how early it wakes me up, but of course love that it does so reliably. Like the bookmark, whose simple virtues I extolled in a previous article, the alarm clock is fit-for-purpose. Yet, I suspect it is precisely because it is so effective that so many people misuse alarm-like reminders – often with alarming effect.
