So, in a spirit of Yuletide usefulness, I offer the current version of my Christmas checklist. It is in no way a ‘have-to’ list, but a list of options. It is also a work in progress. The benefit of having a checklist is that as things are forgotten they can be captured and then added to the list to avoid future frustration. I add a few items each year, and someday I hope it will be truly complete. If you have a similar list, or can see gaps in mine please feel free to send through suggestions.
