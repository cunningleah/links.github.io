The Amazon.com product catalog receives millions of updates an hour across billions of products with many of the updates concentrated on comparatively few products. In this session, hear how Amazon.com has used Amazon Kinesis to build a pipeline orchestrator that provides sequencing, optimistic batching, and duplicate suppression whilst at the same time significantly lowering costs. This session covers the architecture of that solution and draws out the key enabling features that Amazon Kinesis provides. This talk is intended for those who are interested in learning more about the power of the distributed log and understanding its importance for enabling OLTP just as DHT is for storage.
