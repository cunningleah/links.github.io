Windy City Nights II is all about my continuing passion for shooting night timelapse photography in a city I truly appreciate for its inspiring views and beauty. This project is a continuation of my first Chicago Timelapse movie and I have been shooting for the past 18 months in my spare time in this amazing city to try and capture what your eyes do not see normally. There is something special about looking down on streets of gold and taking in the view.
