I use Arq with a couple of external drives connected to a Macminicolo box (the same one that hosts this site), so I don’t have any additional monthly fees for backing up multiple machines. I also run a couple of machines to Amazon Glacier, which is dirt cheap for the most part (you pay more for restoring than storage). Arq also works with services like S3, Amazon Cloud Drive, Google Drive, Google Cloud, Dropbox, and OneDrive, or even your local NAS, performing versioned backups to services you probably already have installed. All of your data is encrypted before it leaves your machine, and the storage format is safe regardless of the security of the hosting cloud.
