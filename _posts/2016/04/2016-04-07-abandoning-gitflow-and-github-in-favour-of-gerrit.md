Gerrit has certainly been the right tool for our team. It allows us to work with code reviews in an efficient manner again, resulting in more time developing which is what every developer wants. Even though weâ€™ve just scratched on the surface of what gerrit has to offer it should give an idea of the main benefits it could bring in terms of follow up on existing code reviews over time.
