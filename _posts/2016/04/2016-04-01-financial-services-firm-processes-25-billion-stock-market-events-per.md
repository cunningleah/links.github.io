FIS, a global financial technology and services firm and frequent leader of the FinTech Top 100 list, recently ran a load test of their system on Google Cloud Platform to process, validate and link U.S. stock exchange market events. FIS used Google Cloud Dataflow and Google Cloud Bigtable to process 25 billion simulated market events in 50 minutes, generating some impressive statistics in the process.
