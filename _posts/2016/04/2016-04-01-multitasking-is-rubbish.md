So I now have a call that is being extended unnecessarily, an email that is no further through being processed yet is now in the back of my mind due to it's importance, tugging away at my attention like a puppy playfully trying to free a toy from the hands of it's owner, as well as a colleague who feels awkward having been cut off mid-sentence while I deal with something that is clearly 'more important'.
