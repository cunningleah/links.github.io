John Allspaw has a long history on the web from Salon to Friendster to Flickr. For the past five years, he has been at popular e-commerce site Etsy, where he’s now VP of operations and infrastructure. Among software architect types, Etsy has developed a reputation as maintaining a monolithic application architecture in an era of microservices, often leaving Allspaw playing the role of contrarian.
