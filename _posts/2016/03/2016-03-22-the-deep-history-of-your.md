Since 2008, over a hundred billion apps have been downloaded from Apple’s App Store onto users’ iPhones or iPads. Thousands of software developers have written these apps for Apple’s “iOS” mobile platform. However, the technology and tools powering the mobile “app revolution” are not themselves new, but rather have a long history spanning over thirty years, one which connects back to not only NeXT, the company Steve Jobs started in 1985, but to the beginnings of software engineering and object-oriented programming in the late 1960s.
