Several years ago we bought the Art Authority application for the iPad which has an exhaustive collection of artwork sorted by period. As an interesting bit of trivia, the man behind Art Authority, Alan Oppenheimer was on the original Macintosh team and is responsible for, among other things, AppleTalk. While Art Authority on the iPad is, It doesn't lend itself to more than one or two people at a time.
