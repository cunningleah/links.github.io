We think Byword is the best of the bunch because it hits the sweet spot between simplicity and functionality. It offers a calm writing environment, yet has just enough features under the hood to make you a happy and more productive writer. Markdown is a great language to write in because it is fast, readable, and able to be converted to HTML.
