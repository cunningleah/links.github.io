These business realities are driving developers to adopt an application architecture model called “microservices,” a term popularized by James Lewis and Martin Fowler. In this post, I'll talk about how and why a microservices architecture can help with application development and lifecycle tasks, and describe the capabilities that platforms can provide to support those architectures. Then I’ll list some of the platforms commonly used by developers as the foundation for their microservice based applications that Azure supports, and finally, I’ll briefly describe our microservice application platform, called Service Fabric, that provides comprehensive support for microservices lifecycle management out of the box.
