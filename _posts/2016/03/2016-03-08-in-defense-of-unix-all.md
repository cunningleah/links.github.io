You will not be surprised to hear that this tip came from zsh users. The ** globbing pattern was, I believe, introduced in zsh, and it would be unheard of for zsh users to see an article about Unix shells without commenting on the superiority of their choice. They’re like those recent converts to vegetarianism who can’t stop themselves from pointing out how disgusting your sausage pizza is. And like vegetarians, they’re most annoying because deep down you know they’re probably right.
