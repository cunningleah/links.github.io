So there is no doubt now that AlphaGo, in its current state, is already better than any human. And it will keep on improving. This is a good thing for Go: now we have a tool —shall we say, a super sensei— that can help us improve, discovering new plays, tactics, and strategies. It will revitalise a game that’s been around for centuries. It will also spark interest for more people to learn to play it.
