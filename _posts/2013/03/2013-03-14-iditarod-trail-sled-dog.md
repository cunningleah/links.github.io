Great photos! Love the tongues on those dogs!

<blockquote>
The 41st Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race came to an end yesterday in Nome, Alaska. Mitch Seavey, 53, with his team of ten dogs, became the oldest musher ever to win the 1,000-mile race across the Alaskan wilderness in just over 9 days, 7 hours. Last year his son, Dallas, became he youngest winner at 25. His winnings included $50,000 and a new truck. The race is a remaking of the freight route to Nome which pays tribute to the role sled dogs played in the settlement of Alaska. - See more at: http://www.boston.com/bigpicture/2013/03/iditarod_trail_sled_dog_race_2_1.html#sthash.5WStDl6Y.dpuf
