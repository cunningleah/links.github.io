Great video of the recent northern lights spectacular over Iceland.

<blockquote>
Kleifarvatn is the largest lake on the Reykjanes peninsula in Iceland, situated in the southern part of the peninsula on the fissure zone of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. The lake can be reached via a track, and there are two areas with high temperature that can be found not far from it: Seltn/Krsuvk and another to the east. The lake's greatest depth is 97 m. After the big earthquake in 2000, the lake began to diminish, and 20% of its surface has since disappeared.
