I like that this can run on my own server. May be my replacement for Dropbox.

> We believe in building solutions that will stand the test of time, and we believe that your data should be yours to controlwhether youre syncing your personal files or your companys confidential information. So rather than use a proprietary syncing service which might not be available in five or ten years, OmniPresence is built on top of open web server technologies.
