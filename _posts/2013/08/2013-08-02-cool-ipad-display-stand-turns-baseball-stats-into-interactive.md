After a few experiments with design, the guys at Labs created a 3-D display that fit the stats slides upright in a black base that sits on top of an iPad. The Season In Review app then shows all of the stats and information from the 2012 MLB season and triggers a light under the slides so that the particular team you are looking at will be highlighted.
