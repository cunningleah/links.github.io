How awesome.  <blockquote> Cubr is a project I completed in three weeks at the end of my introductory computer science class at CMU. The idea is simple: you mix up a Rubiks cube. You show the cube to your computers webcam. Some magic happens, and your cube appears onscreen. Then, the cube begins to solve itself, and all you have to do is follow along and you will have solved your cube! </blockquote>
