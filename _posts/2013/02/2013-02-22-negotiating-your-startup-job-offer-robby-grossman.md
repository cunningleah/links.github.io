Over the last three years Ive been on both ends of job offers at startups. One thing thats struck me is how little most applicants know about what to expect in a job offer, and in many cases, what the written offer theyve received actually means. I was extremely fortunate that the first startup job offer I received was written by a pair of founders who had the utmost integrity and explained things very clearly. Since then Ive learned that not every employee is so lucky.
