RSS represents the antithesis of this new world: its completely open, decentralized, and owned by nobody, just like the web itself. It allows anyone, large or small, to build something new and disrupt anyone else theyd like because nobody has to fly six salespeople out first to work out a partnership with anyone elses salespeople.
