Sad to see Peter's closing it's doors. One of the photos in the slides shows me and friends having a final lunch. Nice quote from my friend Nick.

<blockquote>
In a place where quick-service fare was the standard long before McDonalds was a glimmer in Ray Krocs eye, Nick Santrizos of Edina articulated the days overriding sentiment. Peters is a Minneapolis institution, he said. Ive been eating here probably 10 years, and my dad before that, and my grandpa before that.
