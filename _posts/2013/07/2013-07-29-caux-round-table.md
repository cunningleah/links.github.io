There is growing momentum around the Caux Round Tables work to advance moral capitalism on a global scale.  Since its establishment in 1986, the Caux Round Table has been at the forefront of efforts to promote international business ethics, work bolstered by new trends in corporate social responsibility.  The organization now faces a contemporary business environment marked by both possibility and ingrained obstacles.  To meet these challenges and opportunities, the Caux Round Table has, for the first time, elected Co-Chairs of its Global Governing Board.  These esteemed business leaders both expand the Caux Round Table's international network and bring expertise and vision to drive the organizations continued growth.
