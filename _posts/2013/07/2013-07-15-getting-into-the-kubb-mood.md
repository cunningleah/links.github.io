Nice writeup about the US National Kubb championship.

> Despite the intense competition going on all weekend on the 44 kubb pitches laid out side by side on the green grass of the soccer park, the event retains a light-hearted feel, as evidenced by the souvenir U.S. National Kubb Championship T-shirts for sale with the slogan Uniting people and destroying lawns since 2007.
