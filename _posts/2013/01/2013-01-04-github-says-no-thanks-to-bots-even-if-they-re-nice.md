This seems like a very poor decision on Github's part. Flickr is well known for how useful bots are in adding metadata to photos. Less well known is how critical bots are to the healthy and daily running of Wikipedia. A bot that optimizes images makes a lot of sense. There are a myriad of other utility functions that bots could do in code repositories.

This feels very much like a knee-jerk "computers cant code" cultural reaction, not a sensible view of what can be easily automated.

<blockquote>
But all bots are equally unwelcome on GitHub, Doll says. I dont want to see 100 of these tomorrow. Thats the fear, he says. We dont want to be the platform where you dont want to run a project because youre going to be accosted by so much of this activity.
