Good to see. The assumption is that this is related to long-term hard economic times and people opting for cheaper transit. It may also have to do with more people moving back into the city.

<blockquote>
Metro Transit use was up 165,044 rides in 2012, a 0.2-percent increase over 2011. It was the third straight year of increased ridership numbers for the transit system, said Metro Transit spokesman John Siqveland.
