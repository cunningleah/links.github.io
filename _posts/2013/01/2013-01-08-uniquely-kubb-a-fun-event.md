Born on the Swedish island of Gotland, kubb has rapidly expanded throughout the midwest. Summer tournaments are held in Iowa, Wisconsin and Illinois, but Minnesota holds the distinction of hosting the only open winter tournament for the third year running. One neednt look far at a kubb tournament to see the Scandinavian influence; Its not uncommon to see players camped out between matches under Swedish flags wearing shirts referencing lefse or lutefisk.
