So what other businesses can we expect to emerge in analog-data-driven, central-intelligence queue marketplace businesses?Some interesting ones are probably already being built: a market for private neighborhood security (off-duty cops)? An auction for short-term patent licenses (litigator included)? Technology already enables efficient redistribution for your spare change: its Kickstarter and AngelList.We will definitely see dynamically-priced queues for confession-taking priests, and therapists!
