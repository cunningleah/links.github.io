Not long ago, I had an epiphany. Why must a blog and podcast (like ours) work so hard to gain the trust and support of an audience only to use the trust gained and access to that audience as a means of wooing advertisers to get money (revenue) in exchange for exposure to that audience (ads)? I thought to myself, is that really the only way to do this AND make money? Sure, member supported blogs arent all that new. Blogs like Daring Fireball, ShawnBlanc.net, and The Brooks Review have been able to do it, so why cant we? Lets find out.
