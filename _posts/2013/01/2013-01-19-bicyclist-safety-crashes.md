The 2011 Minneapolis Bicycle Master Plan calls for a 10 percent annual reduction in the number of bicyclist-motorist crashes. To better understand what is causing crashes and to meet reduction goals, 2,973 bicyclist-motorist crash records from 2000-2010 were examined. Specific crash attributes were extracted from Minnesota Department of Public Safety accident reports, analyzed and mapped.
