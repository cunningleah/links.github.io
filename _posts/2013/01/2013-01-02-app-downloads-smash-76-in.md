<blockquote>
Consumers may be slow to get back into the groove after the holiday, but thatdidn'tstop them from spending time in a mobile app store. On the last week of 2012, a record-breaking 1.76 billion apps were downloaded to both iOS and Android devices, according to a report from Flurry analytics.
