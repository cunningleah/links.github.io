The resulting database comprises nearly all non-preseason games from the 2002 through (edit: 2012) seasons. I have not performed any analysis on the data, so what you'll get are the only basics--time, down, distance, yard line, play description, and score. It's almost exactly what I started with. I'll leave any analysis up to you.
