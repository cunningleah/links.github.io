This is an idea that Garrick and I had discussed and even put on 100 Startup Ideas. Kudos to 37Signals for seeing the opportunity and doing it.

<blockquote>
There are lots of ways for groups to stay in touch, but nothing is more reliable or simpler than a breeze123.com group email address. Everyone knows how to use email. Theres nothing to learn, no software to install, nothing for anyone to sign up for or log into. It just works for everyone!
