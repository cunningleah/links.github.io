I've used projects in a template folder like this before. This script automates the instantiation of them. Pretty neat.

<blockquote>
This script looks for a Template folder and asks you to pick one of the templates within to create an instance of. It then allows you to select a folder for the instance and to choose the desired values for any variables designated in the last paragraph of the project's note (by default, "$" before a word designates it as a variable).
