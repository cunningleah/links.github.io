Founded in August of 2009, Paper Darts has become much more than the original 24 page zine we printed, assembled, and bound with a Singer sewing machine in our living rooms. Two years after Co-founders Jamie Millard, Regan Smith, and Meghan Murphy first launched the Paper Darts website the organization has expanded to include a publishing press, a creative agency for freelance hire, and three additional talented staff members.
