The structure and design of most wikis looks like Wikipedia, which is now over ten years old. It does not have to be like this. If you want to give your wiki a different look, you need to use a different skin. Changing the appearance of a MediaWiki (and also BlueSpice) installation also changes how it handles. I have collected together a few tips and ideas here and I also explain the steps planned for the BlueSpice skin.
