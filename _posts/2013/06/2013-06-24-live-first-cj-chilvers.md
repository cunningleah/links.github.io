This is why, when I do it right, I try to sit and take in a place for a few minutes before I photograph it. You need to be there. Not in your camera.

> A photographer's (or any artist's) vision is made more interesting from experience. Why? Great photography is just great storytelling. Great storytelling evolves from a life well lived. Live first.
