OMG. Seriously?

<blockquote>
One key part of our "Internet of things" that seems to be capturing the imagination of a lot of people is the ability to track our activity and other health factors. It's not surprising to get with a group of people these days and see a FitBit or Nike Fuel Band on the waist or wrist of half the people in the room. Today, San Francisco-based Whistle announced pre-orders for its first product, a US$99.95 health tracker for dogs that is expected to ship this summer.
