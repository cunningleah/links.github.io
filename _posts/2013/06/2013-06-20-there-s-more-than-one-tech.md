And there's hippie tech, where tech is about freedom of expression and connecting people with others. Not as a business model but as people. Where the value of a person isn't how much you can get an advertiser to pay to reach them, but in the intrinsic value of a person with a mind, a heart, spririt, relationships with other people, a lifespan, a philosophy, feelings, ideas. I'm a hippie tech guy too. I really believe in the power of the technology to connect people. I think we're worth it. Maybe I'm foolish. It wouldn't surprise me. ;-)
