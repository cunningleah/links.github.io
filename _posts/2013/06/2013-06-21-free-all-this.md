First, you have to recognize that youve been the product your entire life. So were your parents and so were your grandparents. Television and radio, newspapers and magazinesthey all sell your attention to their primary customers: advertisers. Even things you pay for sell you off to advertisers because you really dont pay for themyou only cover part of the costs. Despite this obvious and longstanding fact of life, while everyone bitches about commercials, no one says TV networks are insidious or underhanded because they run ads. Ive never heard of anyone boycotting Mad Men because they dont want to be a product sold by AMC.
