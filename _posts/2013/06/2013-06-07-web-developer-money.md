We call ourselves web developers, software engineers, builders, entrepreneurs, innovators. Were celebrated, we capture a lot of wealth and attention and talent. Weve become a vortex on a par with Wall Street for precocious college grads. But were not making the self-driving car. Were not making a smarter pill bottle. Most of what were doing, in fact, is putting boxes on a page. Users put words and pictures into one box; we store that stuff in a database; and then out it comes into another box.
