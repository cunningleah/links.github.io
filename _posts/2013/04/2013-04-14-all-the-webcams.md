This article is exactly why I've never put a live webcam in my house.

<blockquote>
I undertook this project for a few reasons; general interest was one of them, but another was to demonstrate to people how insecure things like webcams can be. A lot of the feeds were clearly set up as some form of security, but because they were badly configured, they actually do the opposite. I hope that by publicising the feeds in this manner, it will serve as a wake up call for both the consumers and the manufacturers.
