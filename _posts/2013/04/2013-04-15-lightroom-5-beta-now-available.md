With this release, our goal was to add some highly-desired features that allow photographers to quickly process and enhance their images. Weve added more robusthealing options, the ability tocreate off-center vignettes, and a one-click autoperspective correctiontool. Weve also added the ability to edit photos when not connected to your original images. Each of these improvements is a result of feedback provided by the Lightroom community. Thank you.
