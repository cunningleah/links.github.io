Somewhere in the midst of our chat, Erik summarized the situation with a metaphor that rang so true that I have to share it. Heres roughly what he said: The backwash thats coming is a tsunami that hasnt hit yet. Right now its a wide swell over deep water. But you can tell its coming because the tide is suspiciously far out. So we have all these Big Data marketing types, out there on the muddy flats, raking up treasures of exposed personal data. They dont see that this is not the natural way of things, or that its temporary. But the tidal wave is coming. And when it finally hits, watch out.
