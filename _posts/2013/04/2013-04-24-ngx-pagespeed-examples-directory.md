ngx_pagespeed is an open-source Nginx module created by Google to help Make the Web Faster by rewriting web pages to reduce latency and bandwidth. It's a port of mod_pagespeed that's still in its early stages, and for now the documentation links below still all point to mod_pagespeed's documentation.
