Heres what we do know about De Correspondent: It promises to break away from the daily news cycle by focusing on context, not just what happened in the past 24 hours new content that isnt driven by the news. Individual correspondents, many of them famous or semi-famous in the Netherlands, will lead as guides  deciding the news agenda, and making their choices explicit.
