This article is very on point and I agree with a lot of it. It's the "Master Switch" push coming again to control content.

<blockquote>
Think about it: in an ad impression-and pageview-driven business, a service that allows users to opt out of the noise and get content delivered directly to them is dangerous. When the common practice for bloggers is to publish first, verify second, the paper trail of Google Reader can be an embarrassment. And when sites do everything they can to hook you and increase the critical time on site metric or hit you with retargeting cookies, off-site RSS Readers once again stand in the way.
