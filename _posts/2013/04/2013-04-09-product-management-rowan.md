If you say you are a Software Developer or even a Development Manager, then most people working in technology will know what that means. But, Im not sure Ive ever heard a succinct definition of what makes a Product Manager. In fact, Im not even sure Ive heard a succinct definition of a product, in this context. I thought it might be useful to try and describe, at least as Ive experienced it, for those who might be interested in this sort of role.
