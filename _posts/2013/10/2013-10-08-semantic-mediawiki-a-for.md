In this article, I want to emphasis the characteristics of a good crowdsourcing web development platform and try to demonstrate that MediaWiki, when it is installed with the Semantic MediaWiki extension, is about the best platform for developing crowdsourcing websites and that it could also become, with little efforts, a very good platform for crowdsourcing of geographic information. I also try to show how fundamental geographic information systems concepts could be transposed to the world of a web semantic database like SMW. I presented most of these ideas during the last New-York City's SMW conference. Im addressing two kinds of reader: geospatial web application developers familiar with geospatial and web technology but unfamiliar with wikis and mostly with MediaWiki, and Semantic MediaWiki gurus who might be interested in adding complex geospatial information to their wiki.
