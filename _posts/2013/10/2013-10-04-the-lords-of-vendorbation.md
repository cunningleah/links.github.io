noun : Unusable web-based intranet software foisted on large populations of users who have no say in the matter. For example, the dynamic website for your kids school, on which you can never find anything remotely usefullike her classroom or the names and email addresses of her teachers. Merely setting up an account can be a Borgesian ordeal minus the aesthetics.
