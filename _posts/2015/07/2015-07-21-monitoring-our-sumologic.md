On the LogicMonitor Technical Operations team, we love our logs. We know that logs are more than just “those files you need to delete to clear a disk space alert.” Logs provide patterns of normal behavior, and therefore make it easier to identify anomalies or changes in these patterns. Here at LogicMonitor, while our own product is the primary method used for monitoring performance and identifying issues, we also use logs as a tool to investigate (or better yet, prevent) issues.
