<blockquote>
The new battery-printing method simplifies that process. In April at a Materials Research Society meeting in San Francisco, PARC's Corie Cobb presented nozzles and materials that would enable manufacturers to print two thirds of a battery in one go. The two-headed printing nozzle can simultaneously extrude a lithium-ion cathode and a polymer separator.
