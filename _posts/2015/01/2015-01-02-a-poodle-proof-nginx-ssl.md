I’ve recently added https support to my blog, and I thought it would be a good idea to share my SSL Labs A+ (with a SHA256 key) Poodle proof, Beast proof, Heartbeat proof configuration for Nginx. It was implemented on FreeBSD, which means you’ll have to change a few things here and there if you’re running on Linux, but most things are exactly the same.
