Minneapolis enterprise supply chain SaaS company SPS Commerce isn’t a flash in the pan hyped-up consumer app you’ll read about on TechCrunch or consistently find around shallows of social media.
It’s a tried and true Minnesota public company (~$50m IPO 2010) that dates back to 1987, boasting over 60,000 customers and 1,100 employees worldwide with 800+ here in downtown.
