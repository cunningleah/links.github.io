This blog post provides a simple tutorial for getting started with Amazon Kinesis, a fully managed, cloud-based service for real-time processing of distributed data streams, because you can integrate it in just about any IoT use case. For example, the News Distribution NetworkÂ  uses Amazon Kinesis to perform real-time analyses on their streaming data and creates alarms when the load performance is bad or when there are unusual user behaviors. To learn more, read News Distribution Network's case study.
