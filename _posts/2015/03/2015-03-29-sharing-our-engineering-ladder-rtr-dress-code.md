I gave a talk last year at the NYC CTO summit on how and why to introduce structure into an engineering organization (slides available here). I am a fan of structure and the clarity that it can provide an organization, despite its potential downsides. I'm not going to talk about the WHY very much in this post, but I thought it was about time that I helped with the HOW.
