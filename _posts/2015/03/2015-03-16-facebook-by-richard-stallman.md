Why you should not "use" (i.e., be used by) Facebook. I have never had a Facebook account. There is a Facebook account called "Richard Stallman", but it is an impostor. Putting the photo of someone on Facebook (or Instagram) contributes to surveillance of that person. Please don't post any photos there that include me, and I suggest you avoid posting photos of anyone else too.
