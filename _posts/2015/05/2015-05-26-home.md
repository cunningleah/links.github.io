Sixty or a hundred miles of mixed surface.  Finishes at 2pm on Sunday June 7th.  Choose your own start time based on expected ride speed to finish at 2.  The idea is that we're all in this together by the end, nobody finishes like something the cat dragged in.  Please  stick​ around and trade tall tales over food and a bevvie or so.  Click Contact for address.
