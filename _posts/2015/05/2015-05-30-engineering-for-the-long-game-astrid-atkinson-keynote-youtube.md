In a long-lived distributed system, the challenges of scaling shift from simple load (“can we handle peak load on New Year’s Eve?”) to more organizational problems of managing failure domains and development complexity.

From breaking systems into microservices to engineering for organizational resilience, this session discusses long-game approaches to making sure systems and organizations can support continuous innovation.
