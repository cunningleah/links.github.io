 (Nasdaq:NDAQ) today announced plans to leverage blockchain technology as part of an enterprise-wide initiative. Nasdaq will initially leverage the Open Assets Protocol, a colored coin innovation built upon the blockchain. In its first application expected later this year, Nasdaq will launch blockchain-enabled digital ledger technology that will be used to expand and enhance the equity management capabilities offered by its Nasdaq Private Market platform. Nasdaq's blockchain technology will offer efficient, fully-electronic services that facilitate the issuance, transfer, and management of private company securities. Fredrik Voss, Vice President at Nasdaq, has been named the company's Blockchain Technology Evangelist to lead the strategic development of this initiative for Nasdaq.
