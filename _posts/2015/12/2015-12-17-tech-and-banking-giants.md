Dubbed the Open Ledger Project, this effort is a re-imagining of several big ideas. The blockchain is essentially a database that runs across a worldwide network of independent machines—a database that's controlled by no single entity but can still reliably track the exchange of assets, thanks to some nifty mathematics. With bitcoin, the blockchain tracks the exchange of money. But it can also track the exchange of anything else that carries value—including stocks, bonds, and other financial securities, as well as assets like houses and car titles. And in recent months, several projects have seized on many of these possibilities.
