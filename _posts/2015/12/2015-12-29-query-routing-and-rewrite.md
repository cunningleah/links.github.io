Have you ever wanted to split your database load across multiple servers or clusters without impacting the configuration or code of your client applications? Or perhaps you have wished for a way to intercept and modify application queries, so that you can make them use optimized tables (sorted, pre-joined, pre-aggregated, etc.), add security filters, or hide changes you have made in the schema?
