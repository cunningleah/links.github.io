The clear signal over the last year has been the death of operations as the lone protectors of highly technical infrastructures and systems. More and more organizations are placing developers on the front line of rapid response and resolution of technical problems. Alerting ‘someone’ to a problem is no longer acceptable and we are seeing this in many companies as they dismantle their Network Operations Centers (NOCs) in favor of routing specific system problems to the engineers that built the part of the system having issues.
