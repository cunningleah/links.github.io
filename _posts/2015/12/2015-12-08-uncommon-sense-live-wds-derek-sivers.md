So I dusted off this talk from 2011, which I thought I’d never do again, but was useful in this emergency, also because my 2011 book was just re-released this year. They’re old stories for me, but new and useful to most people, so I swallowed my pride and made the best of it. It turned out really wonderful, loose, and fun. I’m so glad I did it.
