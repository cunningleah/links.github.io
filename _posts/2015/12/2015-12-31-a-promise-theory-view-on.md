Object orientation (OO) and Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) are two ap- proaches to software design. By modelling these using Promise Theory we show that we can easily accomodates SOA principles into program modelling. We also show that promise theory can help to resolve ambiguities in OO design, and we resolve a case in which UML semantics do not offer sufficient guidance to determine a natural structure in a program. Our approach offers some simple clarity on the various meanings of inheritance policy and the Liskov substitution principle.
