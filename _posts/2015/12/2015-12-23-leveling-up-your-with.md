A system review is a model that enables a large organization to take action on organizational and cultural issues before they become larger problems. They’re modeled after shared governance meetings – a disciplined yet inclusive format that enables organizational progress and high levels of transparency. This form of leadership values continued hard work, open communication, trust and respect.
