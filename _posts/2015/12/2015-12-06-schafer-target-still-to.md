This little episode may yet turn out be a rounding error in Target’s annual results. Yet once again it raised a question that’s long intrigued me, and that’s how different the landscape would look today had Target not outsourced much of its website for 10 years to Amazon.com.

That decision now looks like a mistake, as Target tries to close some of the competitive gap with its toughest ­competitor.
