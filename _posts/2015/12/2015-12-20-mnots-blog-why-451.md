Tim Bray brought this draft to the HTTP Working Group some time ago, because he (and many others) thought it was important to highlight online censorship; the 403 status code says "Forbidden", but it doesn't say "I can't show you that for legal reasons." Hence, 451 (which is also a great tip of the hat to Ray Bradbury).
