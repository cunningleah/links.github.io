Sabine, an up-and-coming yoga teacher from New York City has recently moved to Los Angeles to hit it big in the Hollywood down dog scene. Hoping for a warm welcome from the local community, she is instead greeted with a trial teaching position at a small studio and a frosty reception from image-obsessed LA instructors. When corporate studio Yoga World opens up nearby, Sabine is pressured to maintain her fledgling student base at any cost. Sabineâ€™s moral compass is tested by rival teachers, greedy studio owners, judgmental students, and her own self-destructive tendencies. When she finally "speaks her truth" to her students, will she be destroyed or catapulted to greatness?
