Below, you'll find my Must-Have iOS Apps for 2015 â€“ the ones that have been essential for my workflow over the past 12 months. At the end of the list, you'll also find my App of the Year and two Runners-Up. Each app has been listed with a direct link to its App Store page; wherever possible, I included links to previous MacStories coverage as well.
