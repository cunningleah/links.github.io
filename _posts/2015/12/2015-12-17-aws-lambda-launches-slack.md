Slack is a messaging app that makes it easy for teams to communicate with each other and with their automated systems. AWS Lambda now makes it easy to get started building chat-based DevOps solutions with new console blueprints. These blueprints help you post Amazon CloudWatch alarms and other Amazon SNS messages to your teamâ€™s Slack channel as an incoming webhook, where your team can keep track of IT operations and quickly take action. Lambda is also the easiest way to create and run Slack commands. A new blueprint for building Slack commands using Lambda functions makes it quick to automate tasks and expose business logic as chat-based commands. AWS Lambda makes Slack developers more productive by eliminating the need to manage servers, scaling, and deployments when building commands and automated notifications. Both blueprints are available in JavaScript (Node.js) and Python.
