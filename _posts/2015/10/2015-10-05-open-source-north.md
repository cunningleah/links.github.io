Free thinkers unite. Open Source North is a local, one-day, affordable, hands-on, open source enterprise developer conference in the Twin Cities. Learn, share and connect with other talented developers. Help our big ideas get to know each other. Get a new perspective on the local open source scene. Because you’re open minded. Open to collaboration. Open to building community. So if you’re open to an experience that’s a little off the map, you’re in good hands.
