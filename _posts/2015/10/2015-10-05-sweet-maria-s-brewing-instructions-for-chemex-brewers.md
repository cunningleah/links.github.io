The are a few key advantages to using a Chemex Brewer and making manual, pour-over drip coffee rather than auto-drip brewing with a home machine. The first key point is that the coffee-water mixture is the right temperature (between 195-205 f) from the beginning of the infusion. Few auto drip makers are capable of this. Over time, even a good auto-drip maker will brew at lower and lower temperatures - especially if it is no kept clean. Secondly, you gain some control over infusion time based upon the fineness of your grind, and pouring technique. Lastly (and I think, of great significance) is that you can keep this simple brew system very clean: auto-drip makers become foul with rancid coffee residue, and invariably even with drip machines that are diligently cleaned, I can immediately taste this bitter, off flavor
