That’s the idea behind Light, a photography startup that has developed a unique way of creating images of up to 52 megapixels by combining shots from an array of inexpensive camera modules similar to the ones typically found in smartphones. Its first camera, the L16, combines 16 such modules using a variety of focal lengths, with 10 of the cameras firing off on any given shot. It also shoots 4K video.
