Push-triggered sync is a new feature in OmniFocus that uses push notifications to keep all your devices up to date. When OmniFocus receives a push notification, it can silently pull down changes from Omni Sync Server or your own private server, so youâ€™re ready to go the next time you open OmniFocus. This all happens in the background without OmniFocus needing to be launched manually.
