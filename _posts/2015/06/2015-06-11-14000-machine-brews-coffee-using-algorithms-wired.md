Lou and Dean Vastardis, two brothers from Philly, launched BKON last year. They speak of their invention—and their mission to “innovate and transform the made-to-order beverage industry”—with Shark Tank-like earnestness. If they succeed, it will be because of the Reverse Atmospheric Infusion (RAIN) technology that they’ve created and patented, which uses a combination of vacuumed air pressure and algorithms to extract flavor from ingredients and infuse it into hot water. The promise of BKON lies in its versatility: The same machine can yield a Madagascar vanilla–tinged coffee and, moments later, a mint-and-lemon infused gin cocktail.
