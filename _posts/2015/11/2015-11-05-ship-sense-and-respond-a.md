From the 2015 Velocity Conference in New York: Getting bits out to customers as they’re ready is slowly becoming the norm for many organizations. But simply being able to ship software faster doesn’t actually mean we’re building better products. In this talk, Jeff will cover how our increasingly continuous capabilities are leading to an increasingly continuous culture. This has profound implications on how we build software, how we staff teams, how we manage and incentivize them, as well as their ever-increasing levels of empowerment and autonomy.
