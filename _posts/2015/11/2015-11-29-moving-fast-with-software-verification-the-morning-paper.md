How do you mesh formal verification “proponents of which sometimes even used to argue that programs should be developed only after a prior specifications had been written down,” with a continuous delivery model? This strikes me as very similar to the problem of integrating security into a continuous delivery pipeline too. On the web, Facebook pushes new changes to code twice a day – but mobile platforms are now even more important than the web. With the mobile platforms (iOS and Android), you can’t just push new features and bug fixes the minute they are ready – Facebook can only distribute a new version to the Apple App Store or Google Play but the user controls if/when they update.
