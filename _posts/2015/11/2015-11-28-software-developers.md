Some, however, mistake difficulty or inaccessibility for rigor. They assume that just because something was hard when they did it that it should always be hard. I remember being laughed at when I told more experienced colleagues in 2004 that the only programming language I knew was JavaScript. I wasn’t a “real” programmer yet, according to them, because I hadn’t learned how to write assembly code.
