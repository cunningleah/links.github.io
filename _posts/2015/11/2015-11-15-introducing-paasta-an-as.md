PaaSTA is Yelpâ€™s platform-as-a-service. It allows developers to declare, in config files, exactly how they want the code in their git repo to be built, deployed, routed, and monitored. PaaSTA powers a significant number of production services at Yelp, and has been running in production for more than 1.5 years. It even powers this very blog!
