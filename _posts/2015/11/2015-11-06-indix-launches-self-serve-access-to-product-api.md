Indix, the cloud-based Product Intelligence company that provides analytics and insights for brands, retailers and commerce enablers, today announced that the Indix Product API is now available through a self-serve portal and includes a free trial option. For the first time, developers can obtain an Indix API key through a simple online sign-up process, immediately gaining access to the world's largest product database. As a result, developers can find products using a variety of search options; compare the assortment, availability and promotions of products across channels; and improve the overall quality of their product information.
