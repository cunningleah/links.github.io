Foo Fighters frontman Dave Grohl is one determined rock star. He created, produced and directed all the episodes of the HBO series Sonic Highways, which is up for three Primetime Emmys. The series celebrated the 20th anniversary of the band—which recorded an album with sessions held in eight American cities—and included exhaustive documentary histories of the music and the rebellious artists, producers and sound engineers who forged music that defines places like New Orleans, Nashville, Washington D.C., New York and Seattle, the latter where Grohl first became known as the drummer of the iconic grunge band Nirvana. I just saw Grohl and his band play Citi Field in Queens, where he sang and played guitar as manically as is possible while seated in a Game Of Thrones-like chair designed by tour engineers to prop up the ankle he shattered when he fell off a stage in Sweden. After that injury, Grohl got backstage treatment for an ankle he said had turned into soft-serve ice cream and returned to finish the show with the doctor onstage, supporting Grohl’s leg so that it would not fall apart. Anybody want to bet against a guy this determined in the Emmy race?
