I would define Microservices as â€œAn approach to delivering SOA by building fine-grained services to support business capabilities that are distributed and organized as functional domains". No pattern is a magic wand or silver bullet. You should conceive and tailor the pattern correctly for an enterprise. Enterprises should focus on resolving the items that are required to support the architecture to make an adaptive platform.
