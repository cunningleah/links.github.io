The Technical Operations team at LogicMonitor is charged with keeping LogicMonitor’s SaaS-based application running at all times, day or night, and has someone on-call 24/7.  The uptime and security of LogicMonitor’s application is the highest priority for the team, but there are also other services that fall under its umbrella.  Some are customer impacting such as the services that the LogicMonitor customer support team uses, and some are internal corporate resources such as JIRA and Confluence (our issue internal issue tracking platform and wiki, respectively).  The TechOps team also plays a large role in supporting and securing developer environments, including aspects of the build and test systems.
