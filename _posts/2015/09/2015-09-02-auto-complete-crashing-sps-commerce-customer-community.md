When we receive multi-store POs from Bed Bath and Beyond we really have no other choice but to Auto-complete the ASNs into the drafts folder. 
We had this same problem last year, and had to have your interal people help with this apologizing and promising they would work on the servers to make them not interrupt the process.
We really have no other choice but to auto complete due to the size of the PO. 
This is the problem:
We pre-load the defaults with as much info as possible, then we auto-complete the PO to generate the ASNs to the drafts folder. 
The problem is we know how many ASNs should generate but mid-way to 3/4 the way it will crash. Since the ASNs offer NO recognizable identification in the drafts fodler we cannot see which ones have been completed or not. So we must go and delete them all and try again. This can go on for days... it's a complete waste of time.
In the event say we need 2000 asns and 1800 complete we decide  - ok that is enough to at least keep those... then we have to page by page download CSVs (max 100 at a time from the search since the "SELECT ALL RESULTS" crashes every single time) of what was generated then sort and compare the store numbers to what we have on the PO... figure out what was/was not generated then manually generate each one that was missed one-by-one.
Same thing goes when we try to auto-complete invoices.
This is an exhaustive method and we really want to know if there is a way to improve this process.
This takes us literally weeks to do since the process doesn't stop there, once the asn is completed you then have to go in again and download the files and manually type in how many boxes sent... which again is a pain because you have to download all the files for this and compare the asn number (which has no meaning at that stage) and figure out which one has which boxes... it would be REALLY nice if on that auto complete page that you enter information the store number appeared that would allow us to reference the PO to enter this info per store/asn.
Ideally an IF statement should be possible since when we pack the boxes it should know how many boxes based on my packing information, 1 box per label generated.
Help!
