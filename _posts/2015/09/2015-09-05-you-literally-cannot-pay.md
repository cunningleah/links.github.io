Recently I was approached by the User Experience field’s illustrious Jared Spool about giving a workshop and speaking at his spring conference UX Immersion in San Diego. At first I was delighted. I’ve already done an online UIE seminar with his company, and the opportunity to earn extra income while strengthening my position as an animations expert in the UX community was attractive to say the least.
But there was a problem: Jared refused to have a Code of Conduct at his event.
