But what does all this mean for SMW as such? Is it an outdated precursor of Wikibase that belongs into the museum of wiki history? Or maybe Wikibase is just a special-purpose application that fills an important but tiny niche in the Wikipedia world while being mostly irrelevant for other semantic wikis? Can the two projects be used together for obtaining a semantic super wiki  or are they rivals that compete for the same user base? And most of all, beyond hypothetical considerations, what is actually relevant or even essential for those running semantic wikis today? This talk will attempt to clarify some of these questions, and maybe initiate the discussion on others. This will also include an introduction to Wikidata and Wikibase, since they are not yet familiar to many SMW users and change at a pace that is hard to keep up with.
