Progress.

> Six years ago, we reported that IPv6 traffic was only 0.0026 percent, at 117Mbps of 4.5Tbps total trafficalthough back then, the art and science of IPv6 traffic counting wasn't as developed as it is today, so this was probably an underestimate. In the fourth quarter of 2013, the total traffic was 58Tbps. By 2014, 0.6 percent of that was IPv6 traffic. In the grand scheme of things, that's not much. However, the fraction of IPv6 traffic grew by a factor of five in both 2012 and 2013.
