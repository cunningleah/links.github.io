Been wondering when Mailpile would get to this point for a while. Interesting approach.

> Mailpile isnt a Mail Transfer Agentan "e-mail server," like Postfix. Rather, it's an MUA, or Mail User Agent. Its intended to be an application that you install on your local computer. Once installed, it runs its own lightweight Web server that you connect to via your Web browser. You feed the application IMAP credentials for the account or accounts you want to use (like a Gmail account, for example), and Mailpile then downloads all of your accounts messages into a local store, just as any other mail application does. Once downloaded, Mailpile also indexes the messages so that you can do fast local searchessomething thats hit or miss with other MUAs.
