I prepared this course based on a lot of research and my own personal experience. Ive been part of a DevOps culture for about two years with CenturyLink Cloud. Now, you might say its nice that DevOps works in your crazy startup world, but I work for a big company where this radical thinking gets ignored. While Tier 3  my employer that was acquired by CenturyLink last Fall  was a small, rebel band of cloud lunatics, I now work at a ~$20 billion company with 40,000+ people. If DevOps can work here, it can work anywhere.
