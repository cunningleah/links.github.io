A code of conduct is a formal documentation of your event/community/projects standards of behavior, and a statement of your process for handling breaches of those standards. In the communities Im involved in, codes of conduct tend to focus on anti-harassment policies, and thosealong with policies focused on intimidation, discrimination, and straight-up assaultare the areas Ill focus on here, but a code of conduct could deal with a much broader set of positive or negative behaviors. - See more at: http://incisive.nu/2014/codes-of-conduct/#sthash.587fDlCj.dpuf
