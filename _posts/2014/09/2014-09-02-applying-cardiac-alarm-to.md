Very real problem.

<blockquote>
One of the most difficult challenges we face in the operations field right now is "alert fatigue". Alert fatigue is a term the tech industry has borrowed from a similar term used in the medical industry, "alarm fatigue" - a phenomenon of people being so desensitised to the alarm noise from monitors that they fail to notice or react in time.
