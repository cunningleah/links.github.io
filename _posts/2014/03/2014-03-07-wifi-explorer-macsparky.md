WiFi Explorer provides the mother lode of WiFi data. The app sports a top pane that lists every available wireless network. The second pane presents a graphical representation of the selected networks. There are four potential displays: Network Details, Signal Strength, 2.4 Ghz Channels, and 5Ghz Channels. You can also filter the list between open, secure, ad hoc, and preferred networks.
