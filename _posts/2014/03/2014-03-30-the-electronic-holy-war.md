Last March, sixteen years later, a computer program named Crazy Stone defeated Yoshio Ishida, a professional Go player and a five-time Japanese champion. The match took place during the first annual Densei-sen, or electronic holy war, tournament, in Tokyo, where the best Go programs in the world play against one of the best humans. Ishida, who earned the nickname the Computer in the nineteen-seventies because of his exact and calculated playing style, described Crazy Stone as genius.
