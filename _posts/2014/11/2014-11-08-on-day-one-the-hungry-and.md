After that moment, I couldn't look back. I searched high and low for a better journaling solution. My first attempt was a private Twitter account with no followers. I'm not kidding. I wrote diary entries as tweets no one would ever see (or so I hoped). I then stumbled across an app called Momento (which I still use today) that pulled all of my tweets as diary entries and made them easy to read & archive. It didn't take me long to come to realize there must be a better way.
