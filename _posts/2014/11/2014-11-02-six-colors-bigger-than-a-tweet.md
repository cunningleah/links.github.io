As Andy Baio noted earlier this month, shorter pieces can still bring more depth than a tweet can, even if they aren’t thousand-word opuses. Gina Trapani jumped in with her own take on returning to short-form blogging. Gina’s “new rules for blogging” are amazingly close to the ones I’ve been working with since I started Six Colors, right down to finding a “comfort zone” between the personal and public. (This is why I will make no apologies for posting about baseball and superhero movies.)
