This guide explains how to install Docker and manage virtual machines effectively. Docker is a Open Source Linux virtualistaion platform for developers and system administrators to build, deploy, and execute distributed applications easily. Docker consists of the Docker Engine, a light runtime and virtualisation layer, tools to package and version virtual machines similar to a sourcecode repository and Docker Hub, a service in the cloud to share applications and automate workflow. Docker allows applications quickly assembled from components and eliminates friction between development environments, quality control and production.
