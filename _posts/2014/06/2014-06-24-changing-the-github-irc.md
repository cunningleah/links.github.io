Super useful command to make the IRC web hook in GitHub syndicate issues and issue comments.

<blockquote>
As joind.in uses GitHub to host its source code, we use the IRC hook to receive notifications to the IRC channel (#joind.in on freenode) when interesting things happen on the GitHub repositories.
