This is a very cool new feature. I really like what Keybase.io is working on with encryption and validating identity.

> By convention, directory signing stinks. You have to archive, and then, outside of the archive, you can distribute signed statements about the archive. Verification is even more gnarly: you have to hash, unpack, check an external statement, download a key, and verify the key via a web of trust or other source. This is the Keybase alternative.
