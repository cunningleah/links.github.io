The things that bothered me the most were the questions or statements implying that I didn’t belong at these sorts of events. “Are you here with someone?” Or, “You don’t look like an engineer/sysadmin/whatever.” People pointing out my uniqueness didn’t make me feel any more comfortable. One time I had someone say to me, “Wow, you’re a girl in the data center,” as if I had failed to notice both my gender and the rows of server cabinets around me - not a great way to try and strike up a conversation. While that wasn’t at a meetup, these kinds of comments can be heard anywhere in the industry, and they’re just as off-putting at a conference as they are in a data center.
