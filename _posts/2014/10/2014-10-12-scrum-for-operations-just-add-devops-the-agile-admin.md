The first challenge we had was just that I couldn’t manage 4 new scrum teams totally on my own. We had gotten the ops team working well on Scrum but we didn’t have any scrum masters other than me, and were low on people designated as tech leads as well. So step one, we just mushed everyone into a 30+-person scrum team, which sucked but was the least of the evils, and I immediately worked on mentoring people up as both Scrum masters and tech leads. I basically led by example and asked for volunteers for who was interested in Scrum mastering and/or being a tech lead for each of the planned sub-teams.
