A No Depression blogger referred to members of the band as "..the Gibson Brothers who don’t share the Gibson name." But there’s no doubt they’re a band of musical brothers as Steve Leftridge of PopMatters described them this way:  "Eric and Leigh Gibson might have, pound-for-pound, the most impeccably fine-sounding traditional bluegrass band on the contemporary scene. ...the reason these guys can’t lose is that, quite simply, they sound so great. Eric and Leigh sing bluegrass’ tightest harmony blend, and, instrumentally the group plays with unmatched alacrity and taste. "
