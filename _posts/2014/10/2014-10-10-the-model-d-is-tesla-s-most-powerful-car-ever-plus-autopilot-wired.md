“This car is nuts. It’s like taking off from a carrier deck. It’s just bananas,” said CEO Elon Musk. Tesla’s next car, the P85D, will have two motors and all-wheel drive. It will match the 3.2 second 0 to 60 mph time of the McLaren F1, one of the fastest cars ever made. And it will be even more efficient than the current, already terrific, Model S.
