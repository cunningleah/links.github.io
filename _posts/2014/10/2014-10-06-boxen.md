Boxen is your team's IT robot. It's a dangerously opinionated framework that automates every piece of your development environment. GitHub, Inc. wrote the first version of Boxen (imaginatively called “The Setup”) to help employees start shipping on day one. It's configuration management for everyone: Designers, HR mavens, legal eagles, and developers. We believe that development is production, so we value consistency, predictability, and reproducibility over artisanal, hand-tweaked development environments.
