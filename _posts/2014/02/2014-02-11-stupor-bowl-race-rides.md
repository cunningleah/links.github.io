Stupor Bowl, a guerrilla bicycle race run on city streets, made its 17th run through Minneapolis on Saturday. 366 racers met at a bicycle shop shortly before the race began to find out the starting point and race route. Racers could visit the 18 checkpoints -- including bike shops, bars and parks -- in any order they chose. The race is fueled by camaraderie -- and beer.
