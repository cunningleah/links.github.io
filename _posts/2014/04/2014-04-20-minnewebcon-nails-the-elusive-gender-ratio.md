In addition to culling a solid volume of techies together for a full day, the gender diversity was unparalleled for an event not branded or positioned specifically for women. According to organizers, 43% of attendees and 60% of the speakers were female, including both keynotes: Maggie Koerth-Baker  Spock-Like Things In a Kirk-Like World & Lisa Welchman  25 Years of the Web and 25 Years of the Web Team.
