Our fourth FutureTalk, a monthly series featuring disruptive Developers, innovative Technologists and world-changing Creatives, was the most whimsical one yet. Everyone that came to hear from Ward Cunningham this Monday was surprised to find that they needed to bring more than just their curiosity and a possible question or two! It turned out that each attendees voice was an important part of the live chorus: Ward had us all singing the Federated Wiki is the song of code and content. His pet project about programming, which he declares is not your fathers wiki, has been in development for a couple years, and has now spawned http://polyglot.fed.wiki.org in the wiki federation. Anyone that wasnt there can catch up by watching the talk video below.
