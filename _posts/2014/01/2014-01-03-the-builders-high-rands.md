Is there a Facebook update that compares to building a thing? No, but Id argue that 82 Facebook updates, 312 tweets, and all those delicious Instagram updates are giving you the same chemical impression that youve accomplished something of value. Whether its all the consumption or the sense of feeling busy, these micro-highs will never equal the high when youve actually built.
