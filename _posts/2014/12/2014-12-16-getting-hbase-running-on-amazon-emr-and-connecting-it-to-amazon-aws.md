Apache HBase is an open-source, column-oriented, distributed NoSQL database that runs on the Apache Hadoop framework. In the AWS Cloud, you can choose to deploy Apache HBase on Amazon Elastic Cloud Compute (Amazon EC2) and manage it yourself or leverage Apache HBase as a managed service on Amazon Elastic MapReduce (Amazon EMR).  Amazon EMR is a fully managed, hosted Hadoop framework on top of Amazon EC2. This post shows you how to launch an Apache HBase cluster on Amazon EMR using the AWS SDK for Java and how to extend the Amazon Kinesis Connector Library to stream data in real-time to HBase running on an Amazon EMR cluster.  Amazon Kinesis is a fully managed service for real-time processing of streaming big data.
