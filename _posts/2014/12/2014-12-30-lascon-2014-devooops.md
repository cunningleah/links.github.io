In a rare mash-up, DevOps is increasingly blending the work of both application and network security professionals. In a quest to move faster, organizations can end up creating security vulnerabilities using the tools and products meant to protect them. Both Chris Gates (carnal0wnage) and Ken Johnson (cktricky) will share their collaborative research into the technology driving DevOps as well as share their stories of what happens when these tools are used insecurely as well as when the tools are just insecure.
