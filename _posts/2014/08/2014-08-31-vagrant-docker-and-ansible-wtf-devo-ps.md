And that's why we ended up adding Docker to our development workflow. We were already familiar with it (as it powers some parts of the devo.ps infrastructure) and knew there would be obvious wins. In practice, we are shipping Docker containers in a main Vagrant image and drive some of the customization and upgrade with Ansible.
