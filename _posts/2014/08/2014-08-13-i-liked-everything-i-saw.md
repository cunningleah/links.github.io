I like everything. Or at least I did, for 48 hours. Literally everything Facebook sent my way, I likedeven if I hated it. I decided to embark on a campaign of conscious liking, to see how it would affect what Facebook showed me. I know this sounds like a stunt (and it was) but it was also genuinely just an open-ended experiment. I wasnt sure how long Id keep it up (48 hours was all I could stand) or what Id learn (possibly nothing.)
