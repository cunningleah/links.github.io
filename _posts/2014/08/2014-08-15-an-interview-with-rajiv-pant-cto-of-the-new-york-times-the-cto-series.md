Next up is Rajiv Pant, CTO of The New York Times. I met with Rajiv at the Times headquarters in Manhattan, where we discussed the newsroom of the future, how the company is organizing itself to take advantage of new technologies and what it is like to work in an environment where technology decisions are so publicly scrutinized.
