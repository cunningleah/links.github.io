The Number Resource Organization warns that less than 10 percent of the IPv4 address space remains; it's time to start adopting IPv6. The warning comes afterAPNIC, the registry that hands out IP addresses in the Asia-Pacific region, obtained an additional 33.5 million IPv4 addresses from IANA, the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority. This brings the size of IANA's global pool of free IPv4 address space down from 26 to 24 blocks of 16,777,216 addresses ("/8s").
