Just as we headed into the weekend, day before yesterday, the anticipated news broke that formally identified the Minnesota firm thats funding local ecommerce technology startup Alvenda. I had been picking up rumblings of hiring in the suite of offices at 12th and Marquette that Alvenda shares with two other tech firms. I guess we can now stop bitching about how Minnesotas Internet and software startups never get any love from the VCs, huh? At least from our local VCs  because Eden Prairie-based Split Rock Partners was named as one of the investors, and I would assume led the round.  The story first broke Friday afternoon locally in our weekly Business Journal, as a result of the SEC filing. Split Rock has been quite active as of late. According to its news page (where the Alvenda announcement does not appear as of this writing), this would be the firms third funding announcement so far in January, two of which are for Minnesota companies.
