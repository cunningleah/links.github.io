Nice work Firebug team for announcing Firebug 1.5, a great release that fixes many bugs and adds great features:


Mike Radcliffe’s Inspector. A key feature, now solid as a rock,

Jan ‘Honza’ Odvarko’s expanded and refined Net panel, with accurate timings,

Steve Roussey’s reworking of HTML editing and entity support,

Kevin Decker’s CSS and Style side panel improvements,

Support for dynamic, graphical breakpoints through out Firebug.

Tested support for the soon-to-be-released Firefox 3.6


This is a big deal. The release is out *before* Firefox 3.6. No more “oh man we have a new Firefox but it doesn’t work with Firebug argh”. Awesome.
