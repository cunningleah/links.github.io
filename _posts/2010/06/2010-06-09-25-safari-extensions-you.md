Apple’s new Safari 5 brings support for browser extensions, which the company plans to showcase on its own gallery in a few months. In the meantime, we’ve compiled a list of some of our favorites.


To learn more about using Safari, check out our Safari 101 screencast on TechUniversity (subscription required).


Web & Utilities

AdBlock


The AdBlock extension is a great way to remove unwanted content from your browsing experience. Download the extension and load your web pages without as many intrusive ads. There’s even beta options to remove Google  ads and YouTube ads.


BuiltWith Analysis


The BuiltWith Analysis extension provides an insider look into a website with one click. You can see what JavaScript libraries a site uses, who provides analytics as well as other nitty-gritty details that are totally public, but often obscured in tons of HTML source code.


Invisible Status Bar


Google’s Chrome browser does away with the status bar at the bottom of your window and only shows it when you hover over a link. The Invisible Status Bar extension does the same thing for Safari!


Live CSS Editing


The Live CSS Editing extension provides a quick way to load up a page and test modifications to the CSS in real time.


Bit.ly Shortener


The Safari Bit.ly Shortener extension makes it easy to shorten a URL with Bit.ly. Simply load the URL in your browser and then click the button!


PageSaver


The Svay.com PageSaver extension will, in one click, save the visible portion of a web page as an image and automatically download it into your Downloads folder.


ScribeFire


ScribeFire is an extension for using a centralized place for posting to all of your blogs, supporting a variety of typical blog features including formatting, categories and tags. ScribeFire’s Safari Extension brings support for this right into Safari.


Snapper


Similar to PageSaver, Snapper also saves the currently viewable portion of a website as a PNG and automatically downloads it for you.


Type to Navigate


The Type to Navigate extension is pretty darn cool. If you’re browsing a page and there’s a link you want to follow, just start typing any word that’s contained within it. It’ll highlight the link and then you just press Return to load it. If it’s not the right link, press Command + G to move to the next one.


E-Commerce

Amazon.com Search Bar


If you frequent Amazon.com, you’ll want the Amazon.com Search Bar extension. It’ll add a new Amazon.com bar to Safari giving you one-click access to your shopping cart, wish list, the latest deals and a quick way to search Amazon.com.


InvisibleHand


The InvisibleHand extension will subtly let you know when it finds a cheaper price to a product elsewhere on the Internet. The list of supported retailers is fairly decent for the U.S., UK and Germany, but more are being added frequently.


Social

FaceBlock


The FaceBlock extension blocks all of the annoying ads on Facebook. I always feel a little sadness for the advertisers that are paying for impressions that I never have to see. Oh well.


safari140


This gem of an extension allows you to post directly to Twitter from within Safari. Links are automatically shortened by is.gd.


Share with Facebook


The Share with Facebook extension gives you one-click access to share your current URL with your Facebook account.


Webbla


If you use Webbla for managing your bookmarks, take a look at the Webbla browser extension, which allows you to quickly add or modify them.


YouTube Full Screen


This extension is a great way to enable full-screen support of YouTube videos if you’re using YouTube’s HTML5 player instead of its Flash player.


Productivity

Background Tabs


The Background Tabs extension will allow you to open a new tab in the background by simply pressing the V key.


Gmail Checker


The Gmail Checker extension will give you an icon and badge in your Safari toolbar to show unread messages on your Gmail account. Keep an eye on their website for updates because the next version will support Google Apps users.


GoMBoX


The GoMBoX extension transforms your Google Images experience by showcasing results in a Lightbox overlay, allowing you to see larger versions without having to leave your search results page.


Instapaper


If you love Instapaper, check out Instafari, a simple one-click way to save an article to your Instapaper account.


InstaPaper Greystyled and Article Tools


The Greystyled and Article Tools extensions provide you with a cleaner style for your Instapaper.com account. Once the extension is installed, just visit instapaper.com to see the changes.


Google Reader – Simplified


If you’re a fan of Google Reader and the GreaseMonkey scripts that give it a simplified look, check out Lucidica, an extension that’s based off Helvetireader.


Safari Reload Button


If you’ve ever wanted to move the reload button for Safari out of the URL window and into its own button, the Safari Reload Button extension does just that.


Search Preview


With the Search Preview extension, you can preview the web pages that show up in your search results. This extension works with Google, Bing and Yahoo.


Toodlethings


If you use Toodledo for your task management, the Toodlethings extension re-styles the web interface with clean buttons and easier to read fonts.


For more great extensions, check out the Safari Extensions blog and keep an eye on Apple.com for its showcase that’s scheduled to premiere later this summer.
