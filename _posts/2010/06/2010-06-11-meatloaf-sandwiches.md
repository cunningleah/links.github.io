This past weekend my dad was in town and we decided to fire up some meatloaf sandwiches on the Egg.  The same sandwiches which won the heart of  Shane Chandler (aka Mr. I don’t like meatloaf).

This isn’t your ordinary meatloaf sandwich.  It has a few interesting twists by itself.  We’ve taken things up a notch or two by adding a bacon lattice on top and we also smoked it with a little apple wood this time around.  Yummy!

The meat loaf is placed on two slices of sour dough bread, topped with provolone cheese, and then finished off on the grill.  They turned out wonderful!  Also grilled a little asparagus to really top the meal off.  As Alton Brown would say, this was some good eats!
