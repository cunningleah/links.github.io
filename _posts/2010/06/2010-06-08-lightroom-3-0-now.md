After a well attended public beta(600k+ downloads of the beta), the team is proud to provide the final version of Lightroom 3.0.  This release has received significant feedback via the beta forums and we released an additional beta release(Lightroom 3 beta 2) to ensure that we addressed the top issues and solidified a Lightroom 3.0 release that is ready for daily use.

Here's a quick list of what we've changed since the last public beta:


Profile-based lens correction that addresses: 

Geometric lens distortion(i.e., barrel or pincushion)
Chromatic aberration 
Vignette effects


Manual geometric lens correction
Horizontal and vertical perspective correction
Improved Web templates for updated color and design options
Additional Print templates to utilize the new creative layout options
New develop presets for creative B&W and Color adjustments
Focal length filtering available in the metadata filter
Updated SDK with publish collection functionality and access to collection and keyword metadata
Improved interactive responsiveness
Ability to upgrade Lightroom 1, Lightroom 2 catalogs as well as Lightroom 3 beta or Lightroom 3 beta 2 catalogs 

Images edited in Lightroom 3 beta or Lightroom 3 beta 2 will migrate to Lightroom 3.0 with little to no visual adjustments.  Minor sharpening adjustments may appear.


Ability to migrate Photoshop Elements 6, 7 or 8 catalogs to Lightroom 3
Updated print resolution limits of 720ppi for local printing and 1200ppi for printing to a JPEG file.

There have already been detailed blog entries about what has been added to Lightroom 3 through the two beta release.(Lightroom 3 beta, Lightroom 3 beta 2) Below, I've provided a high level summary of the top enhancements across all three releases.  You can also watch a Lightroom 3 Overview video by Julieanne Kost.


Completely revamped import experience including import presets
Direct tethered capture support for popular Nikon and Canon DSLR cameras. (Full compatibility list here)
Updated architecture for improved interactive performance and the ability to manage larger image collections
Support for importing, managing, tagging and organizing common video formats, including DSLR video formats. (.MOV, .AVI, .MP4)
Dozens of smaller workflow enhancements throughout the application. (Detailed in the first Lightroom 3 beta blog post)
Tight integration with online photo sharing sites including Flickr.  A new Lightroom 3 SDK allows developers to connect to additional sites with the same high level of integration.
High quality image editing enhancements including

Dramatically improved Sharpening and Noise Reduction results
Additional post crop vignette styles with more photographic qualities
The ability to apply lens correction manually or using profiles for automated correction
Vertical and Horizontal transform controls
Creative grain controls
"Point curve" tone curve controls
Process Version switch to preserve historical processing style


Export slideshows as high quality H.264 video files that include selected music
Fully customizable multi-page print layouts
Flexible text or graphic watermark settings that can be applied to all output destinations

I'll be posting links to various resources you can utilize to get acquainted with this new release in a separate post.

Thanks from the Lightroom Team and don't forget to enjoy Rule Number 5!﻿
