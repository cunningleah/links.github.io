Patently Apple has just discovered a 2009 Apple patent which would turn an iPhone or iPod into the bike computer of my dreams.  The patent shows an iPod (amusingly, the third-gen "fat nano") standing in for a bike computer and accepting the same sort of data as my current Polar computer, like speed, cadence, heart rate, and so on.  But the patent also shows much more interesting features like turn-by-turn GPS, gear settings, and sharing options that would allow cyclists to communicate with one another in ways not possible with the current crop of bike computers.
