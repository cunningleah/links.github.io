Andrew Melnizek, for Android Central:



  Developer Unstable Apps just released their latest update to their
  ‘Easy Root’ application yesterday. Though, just as soon as it went
  up, Google quickly yanked it off the Android Market. The latest
  ‘Easy Root’ update (1.2.2), allowed owners running Froyo on the
  Motorola Droid, Motorola Droid X, and the Motorola Milestone to
  easily root their phones by a single touch of a button.



The developer of the app, “Nathan”, gave Android Central a statement:



  When I first started getting word from people that Easy Root had
  been pulled from the Market I was surprised. I am sure that like
  many others I choose the Android platform for its commitment to
  openness and freedom.



That’s a good one.
