Hilarious collection of memos from 1978 by Edward Mike Davis, the CEO and owner of the Tiger Oil Company in Houston. A personal favorite:



  Do not speak to me when you see me. If I want to speak to you, I
  will do so. I want to save my throat. I don’t want to ruin it by
  saying hello to all of you sons-of-bitches.
