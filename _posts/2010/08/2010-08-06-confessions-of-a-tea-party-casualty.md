Fascinating piece by David Corn for Mother Jones, on Bob Inglis, a very conservative South Carolina Republican who lost the primary election to a Tea Party candidate. Why? Because Inglis is not insane:



  I sat down, and they said on the back of your Social Security
  card, theres a number. That number indicates the bank that
  bought you when you were born based on a projection of your
  lifes earnings, and you are collateral. We are all collateral
  for the banks. I have this look like, What the heck are you
  talking about? Im trying to hide that look and look clueless. I
  figured clueless was better than argumentative. So they said,
  You dont know this?! You are a member of Congress, and you
  dont know this?!



And because he wouldnt falsely smear President Obama as a socialist:



  For me to go around saying that Barack Obama is a socialist is a
  violation of the Ninth Commandment. He is a liberal fellow. Im
  conservative. We disagree But I dont need to call him a
  socialist, and I hurt the country by doing so. The country has to
  come together to find a solution to these challenges or else we go
  over the cliff.
