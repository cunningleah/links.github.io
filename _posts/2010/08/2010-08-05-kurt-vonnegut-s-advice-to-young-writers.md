"Don't use semicolons. They stand for absolutely nothing. They are transvestite hermaphrodites. They are just a way of showing off. To show that you have been to college."


Did you know Vonnegut's daughter was divorced from Geraldo Rivera in 1974? I didn't. This is part 1 of a lecture Vonnegut gave to Albion College called, "How to Get a Job Like Mine."

Update: Thanks to a tip from Joseph, I did some digging and found that the title of his Albion College lecture was not unique. A lot of the lectures Vonnegut gave were titled, "How to Get a Job Like Mine", during which, he would talk about whatever he wanted. Here's a write up I found of the lecture Joseph remembered from Tufts in 2002. I saw Vonnegut speak sometime in the mid-90s, but I have no idea what the lecture was called.
