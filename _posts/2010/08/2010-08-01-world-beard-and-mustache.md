Photographer Dave Mead traveled to Anchorage, Alaska last year to shoot portraits of contestants in the 2009 World Beard and Mustache Championship. The Austin, TX-based photographer's work is available for viewing online, and you can buy prints, too. Above, Jerem of Kenai, Alaska. (via Submitterator, image courtesy Dave Mead)
