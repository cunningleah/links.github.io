Dan Gillmor:



  Throughout the conference call, we kept hearing references to the
  “public Internet” — an expression that leads inescapably to
  something else.



Right. What exactly is the non-public Internet?



  The other big news in today’s announcement was Google’s clear
  retreat on network neutrality when it comes to wireless networks.



Right. And who doesn’t agree that wireless is going to be to the coming decade what wired broadband was to the last?
