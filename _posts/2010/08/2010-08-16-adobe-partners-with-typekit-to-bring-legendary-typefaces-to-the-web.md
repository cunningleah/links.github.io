Today marks the one-year anniversary of Typekit’s launch. It’s been an unbelievable 12 months of growth and learning, not just for us but for webfonts, web design, browser development, and so much more. And we can’t think of a better way to mark this moment than to announce one of our most exciting partnerships to date.

Adobe and Typekit are teaming up to bring some of the world’s most popular, recognizable, and respected fonts to the web. Starting today, you’ll be able to use classics like Adobe Garamond, News Gothic, Myriad, and Minion plus many more on your website — all of them newly optimized and hinted for the screen. These fonts look fantastic.



We’ve been using these fonts internally here at Typekit for a few weeks and the quality is simply amazing. These are the original cuts of the celebrated typefaces you’ve been waiting for, not reproductions or knockoffs of their designs. That means you can use them with the assurance that your creative work is being presented with all the accuracy and technical detail the print world has known for decades.

The Adobe type team has put a lot of work into these fonts, bringing their years of experience with type and staying focused on the best practices for the web. In addition, they have also made fonts available at every Typekit account level. You can even use Adobe Garamond with our free Trial plan! Have a look through the collection. Be inspired. Create beautiful work.

If you don’t yet have a Typekit account, it only takes a minute. Sign up for full access to thousands of fonts here. For even more details, see the announcement on Adobe’s blog.
