HBO Go is a service which allows paid HBO subscribers to access HBO original TV shows, movies, and sports on their computers all in HD. This service is phenomenal for those who enjoy HBO's content and in movies in general but aren't always able to get to the TV. In an interview with Bloomberg, HBO CEO Reed Hastings stated the service will make its way to iPads and other mobile devices in 6 months. 



This exclusive service for paid subscribers seems sweet and we can't wait to see their iPad implementation. Hopefully it will be similar to the website and will play HD content and work fairly well over 3G.
