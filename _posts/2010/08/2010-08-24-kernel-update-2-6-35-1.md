A new kernel, 2.6.35.1, is now available in the SliceManager for all slices located in our STL-B, DFW, and ORD data centers. Additionally, it is now set as the default kernel when rebuilding an existing slice or for any new slices that you may add to your account.


If you would like to upgrade the kernel on your pre-existing slice, you can do so by following the steps described in this blog post. Please keep in mind that this process will require a reboot of your slice in order to fully complete.


If you have any questions or run into any issues, we are available 24/7 in SliceChat. We can also be reached by submitting a ticket through the SliceManager or emailing us directly at support@slicehost.com.
