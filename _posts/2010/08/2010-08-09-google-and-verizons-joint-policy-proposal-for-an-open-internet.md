Just keep repeating the word “open”:



  Sixth, we both recognize that wireless broadband is different from the
  traditional wireline world, in part because the mobile marketplace is
  more competitive and changing rapidly. In recognition of the
  still-nascent nature of the wireless broadband marketplace, under this
  proposal we would not now apply most of the wireline principles to
  wireless, except for the transparency requirement.
