As you think you travel,as you love, you attract.
You are today where you thoughts have brought you; you will be tomorrow where your thoughts take you.You cannot escape the result of your thoughts. but you can endure and lean, can accept and be glad.You will realize the vision (not the idle wish) of your heart, be it base or beautiful, or a mixture of both, for you will always gravitate towards that which you secretly most love.In your hands will be placed the exact result of your thoughts; you will receive that which you earn, find no more, no less.Whatever your present environment may be you will fall, remain, or rise with your thoughts, your wisdom, your ideal.You will become as small as your controlling desire, as great as your dominant aspiration.James Allen
 

This, I discovered, tacked into the interior of a medicine cabinet in a rather dark inn, beachside, Santa Cruz. Typed out on a plain  by this time yellowed  sheet of paper, it had been placed there. A Derek Sivers review came to mind, Do not seek to have events happen as you want them to, but instead want them to happen as they do happen, and your life will go well. You are what you think, as events happen.
