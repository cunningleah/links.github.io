  Startup Weekend is coming to the Twin  Cities at CoCo MSP the weekend of September 18th, 2010 — starting Friday (17th)  afternoon and ending  Sunday evening (19th). Get together in teams with local developers, marketers, designers, and  entrepreneurs to vet, pitch, build, and demo new products over a single  weekend.  Intense!  This weekend warriors’ event has happened in 100’s of cities across  the globe from San Francisco to Athens, Greece.  It’s been covered in  TechCrunch, the Washington Post , ABC News and  beyond.      Final details will be  announced over the coming weeks, but it is confirmed  Zencoder Co-founder Jon  Dahl will be kicking things  off in style on Friday night.  Participation is limited to the first 100, and registration ($75 $50) is  now open.  Tickets include food &  beverage (yes, beer) throughout the event, with reduced pricing for  students and demo only.     Startup Weekend Twin Cities  comes our way  thanks to coordinator Shane Reiser who has successfully orchestrated Startup Weekend Des Moines, Omaha and NYC.  “Startup Weekend provides an unprecedented level of networking, team  building and learning  for its attendees and their communities.  With  the goal of forming at least one new venture in under 54 hours,   participants are sure to leave with more experience, insight, knowledge,  friends and resources than they came with…I can’t guarantee you’ll  get any sleep though.” – Shane Reiser
