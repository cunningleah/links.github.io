Keeping track of amateur, youth, and high school sports -- as a  parent, player, or fan -- has long been a crapshoot. It's usually  difficult or impossible for fans or local media to keep solid track of  how teams and players are performing, and the information is usually  sparse and/or old. Especially for sports that aren't football.

Enter a NYC-based startup called Fungo Media, whose product -- "GameChanger"  -- is taking advantage of modern mobile apps and data connections to  built a really powerful, really neat scorekeeping and stat-tracking  service.

How does it work?


Coaches or other team representatives keep score of games (baseball and softball for now, basketball coming soon) using the free GameChanger iPhone/iPod touch/iPad app. The scorekeeping functions are easy, intuitive, and touch-based, but surprisingly powerful.


The data gets sent to the GameChanger servers, which tabulates live scoring and statistical data, including box and line scores.


Coaches and players get a robust stats package for their team (no more Excel spreadsheets or hand-tabulated box scores).


Superfans and parents can buy premium access to expanded scoring data, real-time SMS and email alerts, etc. 


Media companies can partner with Fungo Media, embedding GameChanger  scoring widgets for local teams onto their sites. Fungo does a  revenue-share for media partners that help sign up premium subscribers.

Fungo Media cofounder and CEO Ted Sullivan says the company has  attracted about 5,000 teams to try the app so far.

That's a good start,  but for this product to have legs, it's obviously going to have to keep  growing. There's a strong network effect for a service like this, so the  most important thing it can do now is continue to build out the product  and sign up as many teams/coaches as possible.

The good news is that there is a real need for this sort of service. I spent a lot  of hours during high school in the late '90s preparing and faxing  results of my school's baseball games to the Chicago Tribune and Sun-Times,  which would have been a lot easier and more powerful with something  like GameChanger.

This is the sort of service that, if it becomes  popular enough, could potentially get picked up by a company like STATS Inc., Yahoo,  ESPN, CBS, Fox, or anyone else interested in amateur sports. (There is  also already competition here -- ESPN has loaned its name to an iPhone app  called iScore, for example.)

The year-and-a-half-old Fungo Media is up to five employees now. Among them, CEO  Sullivan is a former minor league baseball player for the Cleveland   Indians and five of his angel investors are big-league baseball   players. Cofounder and CTO Kiril Savino used to work at DoubleClick,  and staffer Calvin Kuo used to lead the user interface team at Major  League Baseball Advanced Media, the league's (very successful) Internet  arm.
