Yet another MobileMe improvement slipped out the mothership overnight - a new breed MobileMe Calendar app, now available in beta (want it? Shoot to me.com/calendar and click ‘request an invitation’, they put your name on the guest list, get past the nasty man on the door, and yer in).Anyhoo: New features (and you need to be on iOS 4 or iOS 3.2 on an iPhone/iPad for the iPhone and iPad and iPod touch support) include (according to Apple):

Beautiful new web applicationThe Calendar beta includes a new web application at me.com with great-looking calendar views. You'll find redesigned day, week, and month views, as well as a new list view to make scanning your events easier. Your calendars will also load faster, thanks to improved performance. The new web application works best with Safari 5, Firefox 3.6, and Internet Explorer 8.Share calendars with family and friendsYou can easily share your calendars with one or more MobileMe members to keep everyone on the same page. For example, create a shared calendar called "Kids" for school and weekend activities. You can allow the person you're sharing a calendar with to edit events, and set up email notifications to tell you when they make a change.Publish a calendar for a group or teamThe Calendar beta lets you share a read-only public calendar that can be viewed by anyone, perfect for publishing an events calendar such as a soccer team schedule. After setting it up you can send the team members a link to view the calendar on their iPhone, iPad, iPod touch, Mac, or PC.Event invitations with RSVPsInviting any guest to an event is easy from the MobileMe Calendar beta. Just add their email address to the event (they don't have to be a MobileMe member) and your guests will get an invitation email they can respond to directly by clicking a link. Your event then automatically updates, making it easy to track RSVPs right in your calendar.Works on iPhone, iPad, iPod touch, and MacThe MobileMe Calendar beta uses the CalDAV standard so you can view and edit your calendars using the built-in calendar applications on your iPhone, iPad, iPod touch, and Mac. Please note that support for PCs with Microsoft Outlook is coming soon.
