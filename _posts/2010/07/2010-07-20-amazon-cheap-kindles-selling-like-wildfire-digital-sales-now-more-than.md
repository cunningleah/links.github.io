Weve reached a tipping point with the new price of Kindlethe growth rate of Kindle device unit sales has tripled since we lowered the price from $259 to $189, said Jeff Bezos, Founder and CEO of Amazon.com. In addition, even while our hardcover sales continue to grow, the Kindle format has now overtaken the hardcover format. Amazon.com customers now purchase more Kindle books than hardcover booksastonishing when you consider that weve been selling hardcover books for 15 years, and Kindle books for 33 months.
