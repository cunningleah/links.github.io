Greg Sterling:



  ITA is behind the reservations systems for many major airlines
  around the world, as well as travel sites such as Kayak, Orbitz,
  Hotwire and many others. Bing Travel also relies on the software.
  Google, if allowed to complete the acquisition, would thus own the
  “infrastructure” behind its direct competitor’s travel
  product.



Why settle for indexing the world’s information when you can own it?
