Apple today released Safari 5.0.1 and introduced the Safari Extensions Gallery. Extensions allow users to quickly add powerful new features to Safari — from toolbars that display live web feeds to sophisticated programs that filter web content. Users can download and install extensions either from the Safari Extensions Gallery or directly from a developer’s site.
