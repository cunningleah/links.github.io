Ok, I’m not usually a car phanatic, but you’ve just got to watch this driver’s perspective run up Pikes Peak captured on the Canon EOS 5D Mark II (reviews) – this is a record setting run and it had to be with the 12 minute video clip time limit! These people crazy!    We found this over on the CarDomain.com blog where Will Roegge describes how he pressed the record button just before the driver started his run up the mountain. “Jeff Zwart won the Time Attack class with a time of 11:31.095 at the 2010 Pikes Peak International Hillclimb.”  Before you watch this (or while you’re watching), I want to know who in their right mind (and maybe they aren’t in their right minds LOL) would sit so close to the edge of the road while these cars are swerving all around in the dirt part of the road? There’s no way I trust these drivers enough to be that close to the road. Maybe it’s just me – but when my wife walked in and watched this with me, we both had the same exact thought – “no way!” Haha.   Pikes Peak 2010 – Jeff Zwart In Car from Will Roegge on Vimeo.  Pikes Peak International Hillclimb 2010 – Jeff Zwart in-car camera.  Driver Jeff Zwart in a Porsche GT3 Cup runs Pikes Peak and sets a new record for the Time Attack 2WD class – 11:31.095 – taking the Pikes Peak Time Attack championship for 2010.  YouTube now has a 10 minute video length upload limit. Only on my vimeo account.
