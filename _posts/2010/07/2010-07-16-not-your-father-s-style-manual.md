The Chicago Manual of Style addresses some recent questions about citation, grammar, and even fashion.


Q. Hi there! For a sign for bachelorette parties, would the phrase "Bachelorette Out of Control" be more appropriate than "Bachelorette's Out of Control"? The question is one of contraction, because I don't see how "Bachelorette's Out of Control" can be correct without "The" prefacing it. Thank you!
A. Out-of-control bachelorettes who require appropriate signage aren't very convincing, but the first version is better.


I think they punted a bit on the "how to cite a tshirt" question.
