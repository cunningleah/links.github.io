City Guide has probably been one of our most successful themes this year (evidence here). Considering that this is a very niche theme, we feel this is quite an accomplishment.
So this means that after an initial round of major upgrades, we’ve gone ahead and added even more functionality to the theme. Here’s just a few of the updates in the theme…
Coloured & custom PNG markers per category
A Few Pretty Colours
You can now set these per category- either just change the colour of the default Google Maps markers, or you can upload your own PNG version. 
Street View
You need to go this way.
Jumping on the bandwagon of the massively popular Street View option in Google Maps, you can now guide your readers to your point of interest with Street View as well.
Full Map Template
Points of interest: Scattered.
The new version also includes a new page template to display a full map with all of the points of interest that you have added. We believe this is a great way of giving your users a good overview of all the interests available to them in your location.
In addition to those major additions, we’ve also included the ability to select alternative directions (for walking), the functionality to add translations / locales to the directions & a category archive overview map. So there’s definitely a few more cool features to play with in the new version of City Guide.If you already have the City Guide, then simply grab the latest version from your dashboard. If not, use the 25% DISCOUNT COUPON “WOOGUIDE” and purchase yourself a copy of the awesome City Guide.
