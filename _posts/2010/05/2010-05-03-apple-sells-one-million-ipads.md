Reporting on Apple’s announcement that it sold its one millionth iPad just 28 days after the product’s introduction, Jim Goldman (cnbc.com) notes: “iPad reached the sales milestone far quicker than the company’s iPhone, which took nearly three months to sell 1 million units.” Goldman concludes: “All of this data seems to bode well for Apple.”
