People need to pay attention to CAPTCHAs to complete all sorts of tasks on the web...so why not make the CAPTCHA an advertisement?


"Ads are just getting bigger and louder as attention online is getting so scarce," said Solve Media CEO and founder, Ari Jacoby. "So we're fishing where the fish are," he said, referring to this untapped space where users are forced to spend time.
