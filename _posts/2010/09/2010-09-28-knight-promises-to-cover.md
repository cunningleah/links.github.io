The John S. and James L. Knight Foundation has funded any number of experiments to create sustainable journalism, investing millions of dollars in startups, academics and more. The latest effort offers up to 10 Knight nonprofit grantees the chance to try meters, subscriptions or other methods through Journalism Online, the Steve Brill-Gordon Crovitz startup. Brill says Knight is paying Journalism Online upfront to cover the news organizations fees for use of its Press+ e-commerce platform.
