The Denon AVR-4311CI has been reportedly flagged to gain AirPlay support in the near future.  This can be done by a company released firmware update allowing users to stream your favorite music from any iOS device to the receiver.  Here’s what engadget has to say:

Denon’s admittedly pricey AVR-4311CI — which was introduced in late April — may very well end up being the first major product to gain iTunes AirPlay compatibility retroactively. Yeah, retroactively. According to an updated product listing, the AVR will see a “planned upgrade” in the fall of 2010 that will “provide Apple iTunes AirPlay compatibility [that will let you] stream your favorite music to the AVR-4311CI.”

AirPlay is part of the recent update to iTunes and the soon to be updated iOS in November.  It allows you to stream your music, photos, and movies to wireless devices around your home such as the new Apple TV.  AirPlay will be available as an update to iOS 4.2 in November.
