Earlier this week we announced the first of four videos featuring Wikipedia’s volunteer editors, Wikipedia: Username. Today we released the fourth and final video in the series, Wikipedia: Great feeling.

All four of the videos have now been posted – both on the Wikimedia Commons and also on YouTube. The videos are all available under CC-BY-SA. For the YouTube version, consider  opting into YouTube’s HTML5 beta, to support the open web. We strongly believe in the importance of open video formats for an open web, and most modern browsers can now play either the open WebM or OGV format.  The videos on Wikimedia Commons will automatically playback with an open-source HTML5 player in Firefox.

The full list of videos now available:

Wikipedia: Username (OGV|YouTube)

Wikipedia: Nice people (OGV|YouTube)

Wikipedia: Edit button (OGV|YouTube)

Wikipedia: Great feeling (OGV|YouTube)

The videos will also be available for download in HD versions on Vimeo.

Lots of people have reposted the videos on facebook (via the Wikipedia fan page), Twitter, and identi.ca.  Please watch and share the stories of Wikipedia editors.

We hope you’ll agree that the values, passion, energy and authenticity of Wikimedia’s volunteer community come through in full force. Wikimedia is a very special community, and we hope that we’ll be able to inspire many more to join it.

Thanks for watching, and thanks for sharing!

Jay Walsh, Communications
