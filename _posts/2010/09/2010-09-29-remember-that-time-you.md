One of the Ebook Backers noticed that while the essays in the ebook (and on this blog) talk about how I zerod out my Twitter account after a month long hiatus  but as of his reading  I was as active as ever.  Yes  as they say on The Facebooks  Its complicated.  Since the release of #newtwitter, Ive noticed  consistent with Twitter Corps intentions  90% of my interaction with Twitter dont require an account, or interaction with fellow tweakers.  Add in the reports saying a tweets lifespan is between 5 minutes and 1 hour Twitter is too close to screaming into the abyss for me.  @garrickvanburen has been permanently deactivated.
