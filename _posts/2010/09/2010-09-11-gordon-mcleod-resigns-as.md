Gordon McLeod is leaving Dow Jones (NSDQ: NWS) effective October 1. The president of the Wall Street Journal Digital network announced his resignation in an internal memo this morning, telling his team: “A lot has changed in the digital world since I joined you four years ago.  While I’m extremely proud of the growth in our digital business over that time, I’m now looking forward to exploring new opportunities.” 


Reached by phone, McLeod said he didn’t have anything to announce in terms of future plans, adding “I definitely want to keep doing bigger and more business building in digital.” 

McLeod is one of two senior DJ execs whose departures went public Tuesday. Ann Sarnoff, president of DJ Ventures since 2006, left to be COO at BBC Worldwide America. Both had survived the acquisition by News Corp. and several reorgs (before and after). 


Both reported to Todd Larsen, who has been president of Dow Jones for less than a year. Each headed one of the five business units Larsen established in January. What happens to WSJ Digital? In a staff memo this morning about both departures, Larsen said, “Discussions are under way on leadership for our digital operations going forward.” 


As president of WSJ Digital network, McLeod was responsible for the business side of the Journal online, Marketwatch and other digital products. Larsen credits him with “extraordinary growth in audience, revenue and profits” on the digital side and with a “great” business model for mobile. He joined DJ after six years at Time Inc. (NYSE: TWX), where, among other roles, he was GM of Time Inc. Interactive. More to come.
