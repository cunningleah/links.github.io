We’re ecstatic to launch the latest addition to the WooFramework – Sidebar Manager.
The Sidebar Manager comes from years of my own personal experience with WordPress themes, having been frustrated with the rigid sidebars and widgetized regions. Blog sidebars quickly become static, boring and life-less when every page renders the same widgets time after time on every page – not giving your users a very dynamic or targeted experience.
The Sidebar Manager gives you the power to create a unique sidebar for specific pages of your site. You can now tailor make each page with specific content and functionality across almost every aspect of the template.
I’ve created a quick video below to show off the Sidebar Manager’s work flow. (Please excuse the lack of sound in the screencast.). WordPress101 have produced this very informative screencast on the Sidebar Manager for us.

Best viewed full screen.
How do you get started?We have launched the Sidebar Manager in our most powerful theme to date, Canvas, as we are preparing for it’s release in every theme in the WooThemes repository.For those of you who are eager to try it out on your current Canvas theme, all you need to do is update your framework to Version 3.0.0+ and follow the installation instructions on the Sidebar Manager page. Follow the “Update Framework” tutorial here.It requires very little adjustment to your theme, yet opens up a world of possibility! We hope that this feature becomes an instant hit amongst the community. Constructive feedback is obviously most welcome and will help improve the sidebar manager even further.
UPDATE: We have now added framework v3.0 to all themes and added functionality for the Sidebar Manger. You need to update your theme to the latest version. Note: As this was a mass update throughout all our themes, there has not been any update to the individual changelogs.
