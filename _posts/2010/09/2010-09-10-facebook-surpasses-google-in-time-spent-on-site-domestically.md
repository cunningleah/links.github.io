Yesterday, a new statistic based on comScore data showed that Facebook had officially surpassed Google in terms of time spent off all internet users in the United States.  While its no doubt a major milestone for Facebook, the implications to Googles business are negligible since the company measures success based on decreasing the time spent on their site.  In August, U.S. internet users spent 41.1 million minutes on Facebook, which surpassed Googles 39.8 million minutes.  However as this stat was revealed, a greater statistic was looming large.  Earlier this week Marissa Mayer announced that over one billion users visited Google every week.  Its a number that Facebook has been racing toward, however Google was the first to surpass it.    Below is the chart of the new milestone as published on Alley Insider.
