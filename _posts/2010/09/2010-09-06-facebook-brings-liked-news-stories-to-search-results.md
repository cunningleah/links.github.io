Facebook has set itself up as a huge source of visits to news sites and it now seems intent on establishing itself as a place where people more easily find stories that friends like. 

AllFacebook notes that users who search for some terms on Facebook now see news stories shared by friends ranked in part by the number of people who like them. For now, the utility of the feature seems somewhat limited, considering that, as ReadWriteWeb points out, few people who head to the Facebook search box likely want to find news stories. 


But considering the number of news sites connecting with Facebook, its easy to see how a news-specific search page on Facebook could ultimately be a powerful way to sift through the days news.
