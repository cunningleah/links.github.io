Great post stating the obvious for the record (a frequent tactic of my blog) by Alan Pearlstine on AdExchanger.

His point is that last click attribution overvalues the last click, particularly in retargeting campaigns.

I see more and more companies offering CPC retargeting on display inventory (that they probably had to buy on a CPM basis). Â This is kind of a no-brainer to offer because click-through rates are so high that the cost of testing is probably not excessive.

Here is my question coming out of that:

Are the CPCs that people are paying for retargeting campaigns greater or less than the appropriate proportional value that should be attributed to a retargeting impression?

Post your best guess in the comments.
