Wowzers
A good source and provider of information has finally chimed in on the 1Ds Mark IV.

Everything the source has been told says there will be no 1Ds Mark IV until late 2011 or early 2012. No matter what Nikon does.

What we will see first is a new 5D series camera in the 28mp range, but not until 2011.

The word “radical” was used to describe the changes we’ll see in the next 1Ds.

I am giving this CR2 for the moment, I’m starting to believe it.
