These days I do a weekly podcast with Jay Rosen called Rebooting the News. Years ago I did my own called Morning Coffee Notes. Â 

Today, I did a 1/2 hour podcast in the coffeenotes thread.

It's about WikiLeaks, Wired, Salon and the freedom of the Internet. 

New actors, same story! 

Hope you like...
