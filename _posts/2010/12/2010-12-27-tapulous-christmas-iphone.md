Dan Frommer:



  TTR4 has been the #1 free app for several days, and is cranking in
the downloads. Tapulous tells us that peak Christmas downloads
reached 45,000 per hour, and that holiday download traffic is
twice the levels of last year. (It also boasts that TTR4 is the #1
app in 37 countries, so that gives you an idea of what it’s like
to truly be at the peak of downloads and activations.)
