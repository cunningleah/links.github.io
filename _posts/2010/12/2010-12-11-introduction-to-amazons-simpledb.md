Amazon’s SimpleDB is a NoSql datastore with a whole lot of no: no sql, no datatypes (except utf-8 strings), no transactions, no joins, no indexes, no schema, no administration, and no cost for minimal usage. But when you google it, you find Amazon’s docs, a lot of bold predictions about it from 2007 and 2008… and not much else. SimpleDB seems like an interesting solution in search of a problem, but its ease of use and lack of administration effort make it worth at least checking out.
