Dropbox, the multi-platform file syncing application that frankly puts Apple's own iDisk to shame, has been updated to version 1.0. The application has been in public beta for over two years, and an iOS version of Dropbox came out about a year after the public beta began.

Dropbox reaching 1.0 is more than a numerical milestone for its developers. They've also made hundreds of bug fixes, reduced resource usage (memory usage in particular has been reduced by 50 percent), and made tweaks to the interface to make it more user-friendly. The most intriguing new feature is Selective Sync, which allows users to choose which of their Dropbox folders to sync to their devices, which the developers say will come in handy on netbooks or other devices with limited storage space.

You can get Dropbox 1.0 here. If you're not already running Dropbox, now's the perfect time to give it a shot -- the program is so good that many people have wondered why Apple hasn't bought it yet and incorporated it into Mac OS X.
