Offermatic revolves around getting good deals at local merchants and from national chains, but it isn’t just another deals site — there aren’t any printed vouchers, and you never have to show a cashier a coupon. Instead, you link up your credit or debit card to the service, which then automatically analyzes your purchases and offers you deals based on your shopping history.
