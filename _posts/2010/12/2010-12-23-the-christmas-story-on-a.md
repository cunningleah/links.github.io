        Tweet   I was going to put this one over on the planet5D cinema, but liked it so much I thought y’all would like to make sure you saw it… “The Christmas Story” shot on the Canon EOS 5D Mark II (reviews)… it came to me via Chris Fenwick’s blog. Highly advise watching in 1080 on YouTube.          It was shot on the Canon﻿ 5D MarkII. The main lenses used were a Zeiss 50mm f1.4 and a Canon 85mm f1.2L. We also used a cheaper Canon﻿ 17-85mm f4-5.6 lens on the sand shots so we didn’t have to swing lenses in sand.
