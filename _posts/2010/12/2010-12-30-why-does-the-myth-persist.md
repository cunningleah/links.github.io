from the check-your-facts deptA few weeks ago, we called out the fact that many in the press continued to falsely report that WikiLeaks had indiscriminately released all 250,000+ State Department cables that it had in its possession.  In fact, this was the key claim that many have used to condemn WikiLeaks and to suggest that it's neither a journalistic entity nor a whistleblowing entity.  The problem is, this is false.  To date, WikiLeaks has only dribbled out approximately 2,000 of the cables and nearly every one has been in conjunction with various mainstream publications and do include redactions of sensitive info.
