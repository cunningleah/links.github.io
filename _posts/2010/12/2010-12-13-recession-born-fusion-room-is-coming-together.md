Fusion Room specializes in "enterprise interactive" development for creative agencies and clients. It builds on the expertise Muhammad and Ahmed have gained in running ILM, a custom, high-end business application development company that they founded in 2002, in the teeth of "the biggest [information technology] recession that we have ever seen," as Muhammad described it.
