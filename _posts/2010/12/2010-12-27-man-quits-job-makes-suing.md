In this Dec. 22, 2010 photo, attorney Daniel Balsam, who hates spam so much that he launched a Website Danhatesspam.com, poses outside in San Francisco. From San Francisco Superior Court small claims court to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, San Francisco-based Balsam has been wielding a one-man crusade against e-mail marketers he alleges run afoul of federal and state anti-spamming laws with dozens of lawsuits filed even before he graduated law school in 2008.
