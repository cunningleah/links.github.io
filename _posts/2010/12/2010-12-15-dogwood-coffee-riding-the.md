There's a new coffee bar in Uptown. This is news, you ask? Yes, it is. In November, Greg Hoyt opened Dogwood Coffee in Calhoun Square, across from Kitchen Window in the space formerly occupied by Starbucks. The differences between the previous chain tenant and this new local installation are dramatic. The space is light and airy, with reclaimed wood fixtures locally sourced and built. The menu is small, and there are only a few baked goods. Yet with a selection and execution this good, I didn't miss a thing. In fact, I found myself already planning my next trip back.
