Facebook has grown from 33 percent of AddThis' traffic last year to 44 percent in 2010, an increase of one-third. All other sites and services combined make up the other 56 percent of AddThis traffic. But, with MySpace and Friendster showing a significant decline between 2009 and 2010, that has left room for Gmail and StumbleUpon to outpace Facebook in growth. Email sharing, in fact, is 38 percent bigger than sharing over Twitter.
