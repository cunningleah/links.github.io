In this post I present the development model that Ive introduced for all of my projects (both at work and private) about a year ago, and which has turned out to be very successful. Ive been meaning to write about it for a while now, but Ive never really found the time to do so thoroughly, until now. I wont talk about any of the projects details, merely about the branching strategy and release management.
