Brewing TV has taken you inside a lot of breweries, but this one really grabs the beast by the horns. Dive headfirst into the insanity that is Surly Brewing Company with Jake, his personal photographer and his co-host, The Cobra. Join BTV as we crash the brewery on several occasions including Darkness Day 2010 and a Friday Night Tour. Hope you're ready to get Surly!
