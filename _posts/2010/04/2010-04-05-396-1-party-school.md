Thank goodness I found some time to do some more infographics! This is one of the episodes that first inspired me to start making graphics based on each program. This episode shows what This American Life is best out- telling some really great stories while relating it to the big picture, as well as including some great statistics.

Woops! Sorry for the misplaced Penn State and University of Mississippi labels.
