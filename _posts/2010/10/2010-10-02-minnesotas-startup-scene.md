‘Saving Innovation’ – Dan Haugen’s article on our vibrant meet-up scene and how it supports innovation & entrepreneurship was published in the October 2010 issue of Twin Cities Business Magazine.

Dan did a great job on the topic – with quotes from some of my favorite people in town as well as yours truly. 

The article concludes with a nice quote from CoCoMSP’s Don Ball that I think applies to MN’s entrepreneur culture as a whole – not just the social aspects of it.

“We don’t have to wait for some authority group or figure to tell us that we’re going to have a conference or a meeting or support group. We all have the tools to decide we’re going to do it ourselves.”
