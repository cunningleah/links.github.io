Minnesota is behind the curve when it comes to early stage investment. According to the “2009 Kauffman Index of Entrepreneurial Activity,” Minnesota ranked 45th in entrepreneur activity. Not only is there room for improvement in early-stage Minnesota technology, but specifically there is a great opportunity to play to the strengths of the talented yet underserved entrepreneurs within our educational system.   To do this, we created a new venture called Project Skyway.   Project Skyway is based on five principles:  1. Long Term Value: Project Skyway will focus on creating sustainable businesses that generate long term value.  2. Ethics: Project Skyway is based on integrity and values.  By shifting our focus on building sustainable long term value instead of short term exit options, we believe we will not only develop more ethically responsible entrepreneurs but also more ethically responsible investors.  3. Accessibility: Participants in Project Skyway will come from a wider spectrum of society.  We are going to reach deeper to find driven, passionate and persistent people with dreams.  4. Mentors: Project Skyway will bring in accomplished entrepreneurs to help select and mentor young entrepreneurs.  5. Network: Project Skyway will not only connect entrepreneurs with business leaders, but we are going to connect entrepreneurs with each other to build an ecosystem that will cultivate ideas.
