When Apple radically changed iMovie between the 06 and 08 releases, one of the main criticisms was the abandonment of the traditional editing timeline. Instead of one horizontal succession of clips at the bottom of the screen, iMovie 08 introduced an editing area at the top-left of the screen where the movie wraps like a paragraph.
 
 
Well, if youve been pining for a real timeline, its time to re-evaluate iMovie 11. With a couple of clicks, you can have it back. Heres how.
 
 
In iMovie 11, open a project and, in the Project browser, click the new Single-Row View button in the upper-right corner.
 
 

The wrapped project extends past the left and right edges of the browser.
 
 

Next, click the Swap Events and Projects button in the middle toolbar to place the Project browser along the bottom of the screen. (Ive also made the audio tracks visible in this screenshot.)
 
 

Swapping the Project and Event browsers has been possible since iMovie 08, but this is the first time iMovie users have been able to restore the traditional timeline.
