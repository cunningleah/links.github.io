As individuals spend more and more time on Facebook, big brands looking to leverage that time are integrating more features and services into their Fan Pages.
Proctor & Gamble just launched a new e-commerce tab on its Pampers Fan Page, offering consumers a way to shop for diapers without ever leaving the site.
Well admit that we have a hard time feigning enthusiasm for online diaper shopping  on or off Facebook  but the technology that powers the new Pampers web store has potential.  Proctor & Gamble partnered with Amazon and used its recently revamped WebStore e-commerce platform to power the Facebook app. That means that item selection, descriptions, reviews and checkout options are all handled by Amazon.com. The only real differences between a Facebook app and a standard Amazon WebStore implementation is that the Pampers store takes place inside the fan page.
Pampers is the first P&G brand to use e-commerce within its fan page, but the companys press release indicates that it looks forward to rolling the capabilities out to other P&G brands in the future.


TechFlash asked Amazon spokeswoman Tracy Ogden about future plans for WebStore integration with Facebook, and while the company didnt comment, citing its policy of not discussing future plans, this is definitely a feature that fits into the rest of the Amazon WebStore and Amazon Marketplace Web Service ecosystem.
Pampers may be the first example of an Amazon-powered web store on Facebook, but its hardly the first e-commerce example. At the beginning of the summer, Disney rolled out an app on its Toy Story 3 fan page that allowed users to buy movie tickets and invite friends to various screenings. Sony Pictures Entertainment has also integrated movie ticket purchase options into the Fan Pages for some of its films, including Eat Pray Love and Resident Evil Afterlife.
Likewise, other e-commerce platforms like ShopTab, Payvment and BigCommerce offer their own shopping solutions for businesses and brands.
Still, Amazon remains a major player in the e-commerce and fulfillment space. Many businesses build either their own custom Amazon WebStores or use Amazon for fulfillment or payment processing.
If the P&G fan page is indicative of a future product vertical, and we think it is, this could mean big things not just for bringing e-commerce to Facebook, but for expanding the reach of Amazon WebStores.
What do you think of brands integrating web stores with Facebook?
