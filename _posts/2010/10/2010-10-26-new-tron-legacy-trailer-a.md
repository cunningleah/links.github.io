The new TRON: Legacy trailer from Disney doubles as a music video for Daft Punks Derezzed, a track from the films soundtrack.
Much of the footage appears in the earlier TRON: Legacy trailer, but there is some new stuff here, including an actual in-movie cameo by the always costumed Daft Punk; yes, they also wear those costumes when performing.
One YouTube commenter wrote, Probably the first time Ive been more excited about a soundtrack than the movie its in. Ive heard similar buzz elsewhere, but you have to admit that Daft Punk and TRON are an outstanding match.
The film will hit theaters across the U.S. and Canada on December 17, and the soundtrack will arrive on store shelves both real and virtual November 22, but filmgoers in select markets will be able to see a 20-minute preview of the 3D film in IMAX at Thursday nights TRON Night presentation.
Mashable will be attending the screenings in both San Francisco and Atlanta. Unfortunately, tickets are already sold out for the U.S. screenings but some international viewers still have a shot over at the official TRON Night website.
Anyway, without further adieu, heres the TRON: Legacy trailer featuring Daft Punk:
