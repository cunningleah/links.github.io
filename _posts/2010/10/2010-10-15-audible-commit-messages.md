I enjoy a good commit message as much as the next coder. (For the non-nerds in the audience, a commit message is a short description of the changes you made to the source code). At Hunch we found that greping through commit logs was a bit of a pain and instead wrote CommitBot, a script for audibly broadcasting commit messages. You can see it in action here:





The code is relatively straightforward. Every couple seconds, CommitBot looks for new commits, parses hash tags from the message (#female for a female voice, #novelty for weirder voices, #silent for silent commit messages, etc.), pauses whatever music is playing in the office, and announces the message.

Intrigued? Iâ€™m happy. Feel free to grab the source here (tested on OSX).
