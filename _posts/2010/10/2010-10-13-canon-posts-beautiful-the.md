        Tweet   This is some beautiful new video from the EF 8-15mm f/4L Fisheye USM  – and tho I can’t figure out how to ‘borrow’ it from the Canon site so you can see it right here, you’ll want to see it anyway. There’s also a behind the scenes video to show you a bit about the shooting of the commercial. Oh, and yes, they shot it with the Canon EOS 5D Mark II (reviews) and the Canon EOS 7D (reviews).    Skip over to the Canon site to see it!  Snap from the Canon site - click the image to view the videos  Thanks to @KarlHab for the tip!    Blogger’s Disclaimer: yup – Canon is a planet5D sponsor.
