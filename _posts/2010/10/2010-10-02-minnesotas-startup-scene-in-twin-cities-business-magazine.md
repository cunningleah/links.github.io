Saving Innovation  Dan Haugens article on our vibrant meet-up scene and how it supports innovation & entrepreneurship was published in the October 2010 issue of Twin Cities Business Magazine.

Dan did a great job on the topic  with quotes from some of my favorite people in town as well as yours truly. 

The article concludes with a nice quote from CoCoMSPs Don Ball that I think applies to MNs entrepreneur culture as a whole  not just the social aspects of it.

We dont have to wait for some authority group or figure to tell us that were going to have a conference or a meeting or support group. We all have the tools to decide were going to do it ourselves.
