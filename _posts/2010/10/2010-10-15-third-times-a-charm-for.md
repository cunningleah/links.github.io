In 2006, WordPress founding developer Matt Mullenweg held the first WordCamp in San Francisco — “a conference that focuses on everything WordPress.”  Innumerable WordCamps around the world have since united fans of the free open source publishing software, and on November 13th at Best Buy Headquarters, WordCamp MSP (finally) becomes a reality for Minnesota.

Described as “a highly energized learning and sharing event for WordPress enthusiasts”–  everyone who loves, uses or would like to use the WordPress platform as a blogging tool or CMS is invited to attend the full day tech extravaganza.

There are currently over 100 registered participants for WordCamp MSP and ten tickets were just release at a 25% off discount using code WCMSP.  The programming will include four tracks – from “bloggers & beginners” to  through “WordPress 401″ – in addition to the spontaneous breakout sessions that  will inevitably occur. While speaking proposals are still being accepted, confirmed speakers and topics range from Toby Cryns’ “Zero To WordPress In 45 Minutes” and Josh Lueze’s “Creating your own Page Templates” to a “Site Analysis [SEO] workship”  collaboration by Julie Kosbab and Joe Leyba.

Looking back, there has been a desire to host a local WordCamp  before;  in 2008 proposed “MinneWordCamp” folded as a result of the  economic meltdown combined with inability to secure a keynote speaker, said Jamie Thingelstad.  John Havlik and others soon began looking at 2009 as the year –  but again, nothing  transpired.  While past attempts have come and gone,  Minnesota’s  WordPress community has continued to thrive over the years and will demonstrate their collective skill, passion and curiosity at next months convergence.

“This really is a community victory. It takes a large local user base  for a first year conference to be successful. This year’s WordCamp MSP  is largely possible because the previous organizers and promoters  significantly expanded our local WordPress community,”  says WordCamp MSP Co-organizer Lauren Freeland.

StudioPress, 9seeds, Social Media Breakfast and Best Buy are listed as event sponsors to date; TECHdotMN has committed to being the media sponsor of WordCamp MSP.

“We’ve had a great sponsor turnout so far and Best Buy has played a major  role in making this happen as venue sponsor. ‘Thank You’ to the WordPress community and fellow organizers!  Drop us a note if you have an interest in coming on board as a sponsor of what will be a phenomenal milestone for Minnesota tech.” – Lauren Freeland, Co-organizer, WordCamp MSP.
