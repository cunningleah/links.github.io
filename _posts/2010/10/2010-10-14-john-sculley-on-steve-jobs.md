A lengthy, fascinating, interview with Sculley by Leander Kahney. Tons of good stuff to quote, but I love this passage the most:



  The one that Steve admired was Sony. We used to go visit Akio
Morita and he had really the same kind of high-end standards that
Steve did and respect for beautiful products. I remember Akio
Morita gave Steve and me each one of the first Sony Walkmans. None
of us had ever seen anything like that before because there had
never been a product like that. This is 25 years ago and Steve was
fascinated by it. The first thing he did with his was take it
apart and he looked at every single part. How the fit and finish
was done, how it was built.



Fascinating, considering the iPods central role in Apples renaissance.
