From here. Derek Thompson captions:
I'm sympathetic to the argument that taxing "bad" food is too blunt an instrument to use in the war against obesity (food isn't like cigarettes, because we don't need tobacco to live, etc...). But let's be clear: the federal government already has a tax policy affecting what we eat, and it dramatically distorts the price of our food ... and the size of our waists.
