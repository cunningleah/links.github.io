I follow some very successful Twitter users and noticed they tweeted a lot, which inspired me to try the experiment Ill outline in this post.


For several weeks, I tweeted the same type of content I always have  just more often. On average, I tweet about once an hour, for seven to ten hours each week day. I noticed that the active, high quality Twitter users that I follow  tend to tweet at least three times per hour, so I decided to emulate their  process and also tweet two or three times per hour.


The result? I saw no noticeable change in the number of mentions, @replies or retweets (RT) of my posts during and after the experiment. I normally receive an average of five to eight mentions per day and thats how much I saw during the experiment, too, even when I doubled or tripled my tweets.


Since the experiment, Ive returned to my pre-experiment tweet average. Since upping my tweet quantity didnt appear to have any value, theres no reason to bombard my followers with more tweets.

I asked people on Twitter why they thought the experiment hadnt made an impact. Many people responded that its the quality of posts, rather than the quantity, that makes all the difference, and there were also some responses that suggested I should have also tried changing when I posted, rather than sticking to my usual schedule.


For me, this provides some evidence that quantity doesnt matter much in  social media, although I still dont believe there are any hard-and-fast rules.


Have you tried a similar experiment? Did you get different results?
