We use Twitter a lot at 37signals. We post on Twitter, we read tweets, and share tweets. We often share these tweets with our co-workers in our Campfire rooms.


Last night we pushed an update that automatically formats tweets in the chat stream.


Here's how it used to look when you pasted a tweet URL into Campfire:


 


And here's how it looks today:


 


Now you can actually read the tweet in the chat - you don't have to click over to Twitter to read it anymore. And there's a bonus: Any tweet you paste into Campfire is now searchable in your transcripts.


We think you'll find this new feature really useful. Thanks again for using Campfire!
