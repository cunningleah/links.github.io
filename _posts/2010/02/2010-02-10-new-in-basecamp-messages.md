We just launched a redesigned message section in Basecamp. The redesign brings current discussions to the top of the screen for easy discoverability and quick access. We also cleaned up the message design and added avatars to each message in the list.


Why redesign?

Redesigns are meant to solve problems better than the original design. So what was the problem with the Basecamp messages section? The problem was that you couldn't tell which messages had active discussions. The message section treated comments as second class citizens.


A messages posted two weeks ago could have a hot discussion brewing in the comments section, but you'd never know by visiting the message section inside the project. You'd have to scroll past dozens of newer messages to finally find that older message. And then you'd have to look carefully to see when the last comment was posted. Only then would you realize that there's a discussion going on in there.


New: "Most active discussions" section

At the top of the messages section in a project you'll now find a block called "Most active discussions." It's a quick list of the three messages with the most recent comments. We show up to five avatars from the five most recent commenters on that message, as well as link right to the comment section of that message. At at glance this gives you a good feel for who's participating. You can hover your mouse over any avatar (including generic avatars) to see people's names.


 


Now every time you visit the messages section inside a project you'll know where the three most current discussions are taking place. The message with the most recent comment is at the top followed by the next two.


New: Redesigning the message itself

As part of this redesign we wanted to clean up the actual message display as well.


Here's what a message used to look like:


 


And here's what messages look like today:


 


First you'll notice the avatar of the person who posted it. Before you had to hunt to find out who posted the message. Now you'll know by photo. Plus we put the poster's name in bold right above the message. Before it was down at the bottom.


We also simplified the header and footer of each message. Now there's an explicit "Go to message" link as well. Before you had to know the "3 comments" link would take you to the message. We still have the comments link, but now we're clearer about how to get to the message. Overall it's a lot easier to digest with fewer scattered bits of information competing for your attention.


It's live!

The updates are live and in your account right now. Check it out with your own data. We think you're going to find this is a big improvement over the way it used to be.


Thanks again for using Basecamp.
