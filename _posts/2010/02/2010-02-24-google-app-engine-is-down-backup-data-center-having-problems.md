Google App Engine is down and there are problems with a backup data center. The problem is affecting untold number of customers.    Google App Engine is a service for application developers. It provides hosting and data storage for applications.   A post at 8:36 a.m. PST to the Google App Engine Group stated:   "Since 7:53am PST, App Engine has been experiencing an unexpected  outage affecting the majority of App Engine applications.  The team is  working quickly to correct the cause and will have an ETA on the fix  shortly. Please watch this thread for updates. We sincerely apologies for the  inconvenience. " Sponsor   And this update was posted at 9:30 a.m. PST:   "We are still actively working on the on-going outage.  We've also  experienced a problem with our backup datacenter.  We will continue to  provide status updates on this thread every thirty minutes. "  Even the Google App engine site is down:      No further details are available. We will keep this post updated as we learn more about the outage.   Update: Google App Engine is back online but not without issues. Google restored the service around 10 a.m. The service was unavailable for 136 minutes. No explanation yet about why the service went down and what took so long to get it back up.   Here's the latest update:   "As of 1 pm PST, we are seeing lingering write issues with a small  percentage of datastore entity groups.  As well, a small percentage of cron jobs are not running correctly.  We believe both issues are  linked to the unforeseen outage earlier today and we are treating them as high priority.  We will update this thread hourly with more information going forward."  Discuss
