Wednesday night the Minnov8 Gang gathered at Chino Latino for our 100th podcast. Set up by Phil Wilson with the gracious participation by Christopher Lower (who arranged things with the restaurant), it was a fun and lively evening with good conversation the result.

When Minnov8 was founded in 2008, Dan Grigsby and Garrick Van Buren joined Steve, Tim, Graeme and Phil in building the foundation. Both joined us for this podcast. Our guests for this milestone show included Lisa Foote and Brad Roberts of MixMobi; Christopher Lower of Sterling Cross; and our “fifth Beatle” Julio Ojeda Zapata.
