Timothy Armes has today announced a series of “Web Site Publisher Pro” plugins that offer users a revolutionary new way to create an entire web presence, including multiple content pages and a complete hierarchy of galleries, from within Lightroom 3.  Rather than creating a single gallery in the web module you instead design the look and feel of your entire site from there, and to actually create and upload a site you then use the Publish Services in the library module. By adding collections and collection sets to the publish service you can create a complete web site that includes a full structured hierarchy of galleries.  When images are added or modified the publish service will only upload the changes (unlike the web module which needs to upload the whole site).  It’s really never been so easy to create a web site from within Lightroom, it’s never before been possible to create a gallery hierarchy using collections and sets, and no other web engines allow you to incrementally upload your changes to the site.  The are plenty of other pleasant surprises too, such as the use of Markdown formatted text to give you unprecedented control over the content on your page, and automatic generation of the scripts that handle contact forms.  By generating the gallery via the Publish Services rather than through the Web Module the plugins are able to handle tasks that are currently impossible for other Web Engines, and the resulting ease of creating and maintaining a site is astonishing.  The first plugin in the series to be made available is Timothy’s Impact Web Engine, however versions for Elegance and Jigasawrus will be coming soon.

If photography like this doesn’t inspire you then nothing will! http://photographers-toolbox.com/products/wspp/svarteld/
