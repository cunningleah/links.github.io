Apple has released a new promotional video that informs customers about AirPlay, the iOS 4.2 (and iTunes) feature that lets customers stream movies, music and photos from an iOS device to a current-generation Apple TV, Airport Express-connected speakers or AirPlay-enabled speakers.*   We're testing this now, but the happy actor in the video makes it look easy. Just tap the AirPlay icon on your iOS device to send video, audio or photos to the appropriate device. With the multitasking power of iOS 4.2, you can even leave the video app playing, for example, and knock off a game of Angry Birds while you watch your show.  Note that AirPlay is very much a one-way street. That means you can send data from an iOS device to an Apple TV or speakers, and that's it. No iPad to Mac, for example, or Mac streaming to iDevices (although you can use third-party tools like Air Video and AirFoil to get the effect). Still, it's a swell feature that we'll cover more in-depth for you soon. In the meantime, enjoy the video after the break.  *From partners like JBL and iHome.
