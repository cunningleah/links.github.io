Last month, Skype introduced Skype 5.0 for Windows users, bringing Facebook integration, multi-user video chat and a cleaned up user interface. Today, the company released Skype 5.0 for Mac in beta, bringing many of the same features to all of you anxiously waiting Mac users.


Mac users get many of the same features except for one big one - Facebook integration.

The first big change you'll notice is that Skype has been brought into one big window "for ease-of-use." According to Skype's introduction, the new look "simplifies navigation and provides a more Mac-like experience." 


The new beta version also integrates the Mac address book and introduces a mini toolbar that lets you control your calls. And of course, the beta version brings group video calling to the Mac, which Skype has been testing for a while on the Windows version. 


Here's a list of features you'll see with Skype 5.0 beta for Mac:



  
    New call control bar -- Hang up, mute and more from a mini Skype toolbar that sits on top of any web pages, documents or photos you've got open 

    Search chat content to easily navigate past conversations 

    Offline IM so that you can send and receive instant messages even if the recipient is offline 

    Personalise contacts via user profiles 

    Quickly rejoin calls if your Internet connection fails momentarily 

    Floating Contacts Monitor to see your online contacts and contact groups 
  


There's one big thing missing from this new Mac version, of course - Facebook integration. Skype 5.0 came out for Windows just last month boasting its new Facebook integration features, which allow you to browse your Facebook stream directly from the app, integrate your Facebook friends, and communicate with them using Skype. In its announcement, there is not a single mention of Facebook, so if you were hoping for that, it looks like you'll have to wait. In all honesty, we weren't overly impressed with the idea of browsing our Facebook feed from Skype, so we say move on, go get yourself a copy and give it a go.
