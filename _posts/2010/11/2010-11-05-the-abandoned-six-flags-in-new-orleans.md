Creepy video by Teddy Smith, touring the abandoned Six Flags New Orleans, destroyed by Hurricane Katrina five years ago. (So nice to watch full-screen HD video without my MacBook Pro’s fan kicking in.)


Update 1: Here’s an aerial photo of the theme park taken on 14 September 2005. Unreal.


Update 2: Great Flickr set of photos from the park.
