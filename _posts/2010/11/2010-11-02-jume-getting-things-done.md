Jume is a task management app with a difference: It incorporates social features. The idea is that by making your to-do lists public, you can lean on your friends and contacts for motivation and help.



Once youve signed up, you can take a look through the tasks that other people have shared in a Facebook-like Feed which shows you tasks entered by you and your friends (you can sign in with Facebook to connect with friends using the service), popular tasks and people near you. Again taking cues from social apps like Facebook, you can like and comment on other peoples tasks. Entering your own tasks is just a matter of saying what you want to do and when you want to do it by.



Its quite a slickly designed app and its a nice idea in theory, but it falls down for a couple of reasons. Firstly, Jumes task management features are really very rudimentary when compared with many of the popular to-do list apps like Remember the Milk; you couldnt use it in a GTD system, for example. And although you can mark tasks as private, the whole point of Jume is sharing your tasks with others, which means that its almost certainly not going to be suitable for recording work-related tasks; most of the tasks shared by existing users seem to be fairly generic, like take a vacation. Id like to see an option to decide to share certain tasks with limited groups of people; that way you could share work-related task only with your colleagues. Secondly, it really needs to have a large number of people using it for the social features to be useful. Even though Jume has been in beta for a couple of months now, activity is low and there doesnt  appear to be that many people using it; it feels a little deserted. Id suggest that if youre looking for a collaborative task management app with built-in social features that you take a look at Producteev instead.

Let us know what you think of Jume in the comments.
