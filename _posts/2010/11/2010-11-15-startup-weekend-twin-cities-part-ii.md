Despite the lamenting by some on the lack of a startup community here in the Twin Cities, events such as Startup Weekend being held this weekend (Nov. 19-21) prove otherwise.  This is the second Startup Weekend to be held in the Twin Cities in the past few months. Minnesota startups like Qonqr,Rock Your Block, Heavy Analytics, Locate My Deal and others originated from the first Startup Weekend Twin Cities held in September.  Startup Weekend recruits a highly motivated group of developers, business managers, startup enthusiasts, marketing gurus, graphic artists and more to a 54 hour event that builds communities, companies and projects. It is an amazing opportunity to connect with other passionate and skilled individuals, and perhaps even find a co-founder or two to transform your idea into reality.  Augusoft President and CEO Cem Erdem will be a judge at this weekend’s event, and will also share his vision for Project Skyway.  We are excited to see who will be amongst Minnesota’s next class of Startup Weekend grads.  Final Details for Startup Weekend Twin Cities 2 at U of M Carlson School of Management Nov 19-21 can be found here.
