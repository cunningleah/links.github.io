W3i has officially launched a new mobile game publishing venture called  Recharge Studios, in addition to a $1m (minimum) fund targeted at iOS  mobile gaming startups.

“The tech industry is clearly growing in the area of free-to-play  mobile/social gaming and Minnesota needs to have to have it’s own  dedicated resource in this space,” declares Robert Weber, VP and Co founder  of parent company W3i.

As a wholly-owned subsidiary, Recharge Studios is specifically seeking  to fund iOS developers/teams with an original game concept or prototype,  past development experience, business and marketing plan, commitment to  the freemium revenue model and plans for social game mechanics.  Compulsion loop, time management or simulation games are types of the gaming sub genres of interest to Recharge, who  anticipates the funding of at least 10 new gaming startups — beginning  next month.

It’s estimated that there’s between 200,000 – 300,000 apps (including games) the iOS App Store;  newcomers to the  gaming world often face challenges to get their new game(s) discovered,  which is where W3i sees experience coming into play. “This is a a  chance for developers near and far to partner with a company with more  than a decade of distribution and monetization experience with top  consumer applications,” says Weber.

With the launch of Recharge Studios, game developers can gain access to  capital and marketing resources, as well as production expertise and support staff. The boutique is  currently building a small staff of experienced product managers and marketers.

W3i was started by the Weber bros. — Aaron, Rob and Ryan — on the  campus of St. Cloud State University in 2000 .  The company’s core business is  built on the desktop app side, where app publishers get paid for  recommending relevant applications through a technology known as InstallIQ, which gives advertisers a mass distribution channel. InstallIQ has facilitated more than 400  million app installs–including over 100 million in 2009 alone.

Aaron has since moved on to Co-found Inveni, while Rob and Ryan continued  to see the company reach tens of millions in annual revenue.  In  June, W3i  launched Apperang — a product that pays consumers to  download mobile applications, which in turn, drives traffic rankings for  developers.

“There’s a market opportunity for the developer who can move fast and we will help the right talent seize it,” says Weber, adding “We are the  co-producers.”
