Surprisingly, there has been very few applications that have been birthed and the ones that do exist are limited. That might very possibly change with the release of iOS 4.2. Algoriddim, the group who develops the popular djay application for the Mac, has intention in taking full advantage of the new audio capabilities of the new software update. The group has ported their application for the Mac to iOS and is twaeking it to perfection for the iPad.
