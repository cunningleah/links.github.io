How is Facebook fragmenting the universality and decentralization principlesof the Web? Well, my friends, it all comes down to profit and competition.Facebook or LinkedIn, says Berners-Lee, let you keep exhorbitant amounts of personal data, but only within their sites. That is to say, in claiming that they need to protect your privacy and add tailored services based on your personal tastes, interests, and connections, social networking sites collect your data but dont let you use it on other sites.
