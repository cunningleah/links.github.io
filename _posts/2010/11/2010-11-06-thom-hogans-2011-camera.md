Every year, Thom looks back and the year past and then turns his attention to making predictions for the next year. He sees 2011 as being a potentially good year for the players that execute well, and very dangerous to those that don’t. Thom specializes in commenting on Nikon, but these write ups look at every major player in the industry.
