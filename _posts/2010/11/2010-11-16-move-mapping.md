Move mapping: Map your moves is a visual exploration of where New Yorkers moved in the last decade by Moritz Stefaner:


This map distills more than 4000 moves from over 1700 people, collected in an informal survey by WNYC, a New York based public radio station.

The right side of the map shows some statistics on why people moved to the selected areas, including the simple and motivated “wanted to move to the New York area.”
