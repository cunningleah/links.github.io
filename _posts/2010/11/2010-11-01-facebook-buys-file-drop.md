Facebook has made a small acquisition, buying up drop.io, a service that lets users upload files online and then share them. Drop.io says Facebook has bought most of its technology and assets and that founder Sam Lessin will now join Facebook. The Drop.io service itself will shut down. 

This follows a pattern of other similar talent acquisitions for Facebook; over the last year, it has purchased a series of startups including Hot Potato, Nextstop, and ShareGroove, and has integrated those companies teams, while simultaneously discontinuing their products.
