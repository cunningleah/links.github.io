A shameless plug for our good friend, former Adobe employee and Lightroom Evangelist George Jardine.  George created an excellent set of tutorials focused on image management and organizational tools and has now created a new set of tutorials to address the wealth of functionality in the Develop module.  Check them out here. ($24.95) And if you didn’t heed my earlier recommendation to listen to George’s series of podcasts with photographic influencers, now’s the time to queue them up! (Free of charge)
