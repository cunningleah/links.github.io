  Schmidt speaks at Web 2.0. Lots of Apple-related nuggets. Quick rundown for the time-challenged:   NFC support as Android apes Apple on ‘iWallet’ Android is for touch, Chrome OS for netbooks I said there wouldn’t be a Nexus Two, not that there would never be a Nexus S Gingerbread is coming Google will be leaving it up to third-party applications developers to create NFC apps (sold via the oh so secure Android store)
