  A few days ago, we found some more Canon EOS 5D Mark II (reviews) aerial videos done by quadrocopter and so we contacted them to find out a little bit more about what they’re doing.



We talked with Jeff Scholl from quadrocopter and he sent us this bit of info about their latest shoot:

While traveling from NW Montana to Eastern Idaho for a video job I decided to bring everything that would fit in my car.

I wanted a few twilight timelapses so I brought a 5dmk2 with all my wide glass. I also wanted some aerial river B-roll so I parked next to a few kayak spots along the Lochsa river and tried out the new Hexakopter XL. The Hexakopter is a multirotor helicopter that performs like an infinite jib for low level aerial work. The 5dmk2 is a perfect payload for this Hexakopter and I am impressed how precisely it flys the camera.

The camera gimbal is hard mounted to the frame so I’m keeping it wide with the 20mm 2.8 until I can try out silicon dampners for the longer glass.

One of the limitations of the 5dmk2 on this platform is the inherent rolling shutter. If the wind starts bouncing the footage I swap out the 5d for a T2i at 720 60P which cleans up any jello effects.

In no wind conditions or interior work the 5dmk2 is my dslr of choice. However I’m looking into my crystal ball for a 5dmk3 with fast refresh rates and 1080 60P.

Here’s another recent video that Jeff shared:

One of our clients from Chile arrived at Quadrocopter today so we gave Daniel a quick demo of the XL lifting the Canon 5dmk2/20mm 2.8. It has finally stopped raining here in NW Montana so we got to fly outside! 


If you’re really wanting to get involved in your own Quadrocopter, you can with their Ready To Fly platforms!

OUR READY TO FLY™ PLATFORMS

All our RTF™ platforms are professionally built in-house, directly by our company. They are therefore delivered to you fully assembled, configured and flown-in and come with all parameters adjusted.

Our RTF™ platforms include the Mikrokopter Tool Software and full Xbee 900Mhz setup for easy communication with your computer. The Xbee setup will enable you to receive live flight data on your computer like elevation, position, ESC temperature, battery charge, voltage and much more.

The first flight of your custom MikroKopter is documented in a video that we will send to you prior to sending the RTF platform. This video documentation is proof of the flight ability of your Kopter and the functionality of all additional components.

EVERYTHING you need to start flying right out of the box is included and packaged in our custom military or birch plywood cases that fits and fully protects all the components.
