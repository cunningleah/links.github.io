Accelerator Programs such as Y-Combinator (Silicon Valley) and TechStars (Boston, Boulder, NY, Seattle) have in many ways taken on the role of VC firms to help mentor emerging tech companies develop their product, create a business plan and connect them with investors to provide necessary seed funding.

While Y-Combinator and TechStars are the two best known programs out there today, there are roughly 50 to 75 tech accelerator programs now throughout North America and Europe, with two recently just starting in Chicago (Excelerate & Lightbank). These include programs such as AlphaLab (Pittsburg), BoomStartUp (Utah), Bootup Labs (Vancouver), DreamIt (Philadelphia), The Founder Institute (Silicon Valley and several other cities now), Seedcamp (London/Europe), and SeedRocket (Spain).

To date there has been no such program like this to emerge in the Twin Cities or Minnesota. We at Project Skyway not only believe this region can use something like this, but we can do it better and in a way that is uniquely Minnesotan.

How will Project Skyway be different?

For one, we intend to invest in people, not just ideas. We are seeking people with dedication and a passion for excellence. What does this mean? Here are some examples of philosophies that we think will work well in Project Skyway:


My startup team can be both focused and balanced.
As an entrepreneur I can impact not just my employees and customers, but also the greater community.
I can run my startup with integrity and still win big.
We should lead and instigate change. Coding will only take us so far.
I can learn better from other entrepreneurs than from anyone.

We are not interested in attracting people that adhere to the philosophy of “getting rich quick,” or feeding into the “Business Porn” that loves to report about the latest 20 something that drops out of school and strikes it rich by raising a couple of million dollars in three months. This is the equivalent of winning the lottery. While we are not opposed to making money or profits, we believe in teaching entrepreneurs the value of hard work and building companies that will last a long time. We are looking for entrepreneurs with the passion, persistence and drive to make it happen, no matter how long it takes.

We have also noticed that many of the accelerator programs out there mainly cater to computer coders. Project Skyway is not after coders and will not be a “code fest.” Instead we will provide entrepreneurs with access to developers (if needed) that can help them achieve their vision in an affordable way, much the same way a “fab lab” provides the tools for entrepreneurs to build almost anything they like.

Finally, raising VC money will be an option, but will not be required. After going through the Project Skyway program, graduates may continue on and raise VC funding if they so choose. However, raising a large amount of funding will not be the sole goal of our program, and may not even be required if the business can become profitable on its own.

While many of the details of Project Skyway are still coming together, we feel it is important to differentiate ourselves from the many accelerator programs out there today. We welcome all comments and feedback on our vision.
