$2.99 calendar app for the iPhone and iPod Touch, with an emphasis on fast, convenient event creation and a very crisp, stylish UI design. Behind the scenes, it’s built on the iOS system level calendaring APIs, so it syncs perfectly with the built-in Calendar app. I have a few niggles, but Mysterious Trousers — the excellently-named developers of the app — are improving it at a very steady clip.
